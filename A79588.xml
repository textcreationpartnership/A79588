            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that we are fallen into an Age of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> that ſwarm more now then ever, partly by reaſon that there are ſo many that (as things now ſtand) have hardly any other Trade of life to take to; and partly alſo through the Natural Itch that moſt men have to appear to the world ſome way or other, (eſpecially ſince they find ſo good reception from ſuch Readers, as either cannot, or will not take the pains to peruſe Authors in their Originals) I have alſo adventured to preſent thee here with a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> which, if thou underſtand it, thou wilt thank me for; if thou doſt not, thy cenſure concerns me not.</p>
            <p>But firſt, before I put thee upon the reading of the Book it ſelf, I ſhall by the way take liberty to give thee ſome little, but neceſſary Information, touching theſe three following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Author of this Piece. 2. The Uſe that may be made of it: and 3. Of this preſent <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of it into Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as for the Author, He was a man that was as famous for his Sufferings, as for his Learning; for notwithſtanding that he was a Roman Catholick, nay a Frier, and withal ſo eager and hearty an Aſſerter, and Maintainer of the Roman Catholick Sea, and Its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; yet for all this do we find him in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and ſo terribly tormented there, as that the Learned <hi>J. Gaffarel,</hi> a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being at <hi>Rome,</hi> where our Author was then in Dureſſe, and having a deſire to ſee him, he went with ſome friends to the Place where he was, where he found him (as he expreſſeth himſelf in his <hi>Curioſitez Inouyes,</hi> cap. 7.) <hi>ayant le gras des jambes toutes meurtries, &amp; les feſſes preſque ſans chair, la luy ayant arrachée par morceaux, aſin
<pb facs="tcp:118554:3"/>de tirer de luy la confeſſion des crimes dont on l'accuſoit:</hi> with the Calves of his Legs beaten black and blue all over, and with ſcarſely any fleſh at all upon his buttocks; it having been torn from him peice-meal, to force him to the confeſſion of ſuch crimes as they had accuſed him of. Niether were theſe his ſufferings of any ſhort Continuance, as appears out of his own words, as in other places, ſo in this Book of his now in our hands; where we have him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating unto us (as I conceive) theſe his ſufferings, and calling them <hi>Decennalem Afflictionem,</hi> his <hi>Ten years Affliction,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to this Book: and in the laſt Chapter of it, <hi>Decennalem miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> his <hi>Ten years miſery.</hi> But of the reaſon of theſe his ſufferings, I am not at preſent able to give thee any very good Account: only the afore cited <hi>J. Gaffarel</hi> there tells us, that there was at that time an Expectation abroad of A ful Relation of his whole life; for, ſaith he, <hi>Mais un ſeavant Altman faira voir en peu de temps, l' hiſtoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re de ſes malheurs, &amp; de ſa vie:</hi> A certain Learned <hi>German</hi> will ere long give us the hiſtorie of his Misfortunes, and of his Life. Now whether any ſuch Diſcourſe of <hi>Campanella's</hi> Life ever came forth or not, I know not; I confeſſe it never came to my hand.</p>
            <p>So much for the Authors Sufferings. And as for his Learning, whoſoever would underſtand how large, and General that was, muſt not ſtay upon this our preſent Treatiſe, but may have recourſe to other Tracts of his, that are written of Several Subjects, both in Divinity, Philoſophy, Politicks, Aſtrology, and what not! which the ſhops will every where furniſh him with.</p>
            <p>As for this preſent Diſcourſe, touching the Spaniſh Monarchy, I confeſſe I cannot yet diſcover in what Language it was firſt written by the Author; but I find that the Latine which is now Lately come abroad, and goes under the name of the Laſt Edition, and is ſet forth by <hi>Lodwick Elzivir</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> is the Third Edition of it, and pretends to the mending of what was amiſſe and corrupt in the two former Editions.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that we have now, in a manner, found a kind of an Accompliſhment of ſome Counſels of his, that were given long ago, as namely, touching a war with the Dutch, it would not be amiſſe to examine about what time this Book was written. Now though the very time of the writing of it is now here preciſely ſet down; yet there are ſome Circumſtances let fall here and there in the Book, that may ſerve to guide our Conjecture by. And I therefore conceive it to have been written about 53, or 54 years
<pb facs="tcp:118554:3"/>ſince. For, it is plain, that it was written in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and after 88. and indeed when the Queen was now grown very Old, and that King <hi>James</hi> was in daily expectation of the Engliſh Crown falling to Him. But this does not do the buſineſſe: we can bring it yet nearer home then ſo; for in his Chap. XXIV. of <hi>France,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. King of <hi>France,</hi> he ſayes that <hi>Jam in declivi aetate eſt, nec ſucceſſorem nec nxorem habet;</hi> He now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be an old man, and hath neither ſucceſſor nor Wife. Now the time here pointed out, I conceive to be the year of our Lord 1599. or the following year, 1600. for in the firſt of theſe years King <hi>Henry</hi> was divorced from <hi>Margaret,</hi> his former Wife, and he married the year following <hi>Catharine de Medicis,</hi> by whom he afterwards had iſſue, <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. &amp;c. In one of theſe years therefore I ſuppoſe the Author to have written this book.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Uſe of it, we have here laid down, both in a Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical and copious way, a perfect Model both of the Original, and Principles of Government. For here weare inſtructed both how Princes ought to treat their Subjects at home, and alſo how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age their Affaires abroad, towards other Forreign Kingdomes and Republicks. We have here, as it were, a Political Glaſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have preſented unto us a view of each particular Country, Province, Kingdom and Empire through the whole World; as alſo by what waies of Government, whether by ſtrict Juſtice, or Lenity, a ſtrait, or a looſe Rain they are to be governed, and kept in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: as likewiſe the Cauſes of the Riſe and Fall of each ſeverall Kingdom, and Empire; together with the Dangers and Hazards they were expoſed to, and the Advantages they had to boaſt of; and all this Illuſtrated and confirmed by ſeveral examples, taken both out of Profane, and Sacred Writers. Now although this be deſigned wholly, and modelled out, in reference to the Spaniſh Monarchy only, and the ſupport of the Papacy; yet may all wiſe, Judicious men make very good uſe of the ſame, and apply what Counſells are here given the King of Spain, to their own Affaires.</p>
            <p>For, if it be good counſel for the King of Spain to take, <hi>To procure and maintain a peferct <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion among his own ſubjects at home;</hi> but on the Contrary, <hi>To ſow the ſeeds of Diviſion among his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad:</hi> the ſame muſt be as good Counſel for the King of <hi>France</hi> alſo to take, or any other Prince, or Potentate what ever. If it be good Counſel to the Spaniard, <hi>Never to truſt ſo much to any peace made with an Enemy, as thereupon quite to lay aſide his Armes:</hi> it is altogether as good Counſel for any other Prince,
<pb facs="tcp:118554:4"/>And the ſame may be ſaid of any other of the General <hi>Maxims</hi> of Policy delivered here by our Author. But as for what in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concerns the Advancement of the Spaniard and his Deſigns, in order to the bringing about of his Univerſal Monarchy; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rules by our Author laid down were in ſufficient to do the buſineſſe: or whether, hough they were every way as full and proper as could be, yet having not been preciſely obſerved, the buſineſſe hath miſcarried, and the Spaniard hath not as yet arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and perhaps now is never like to arrive to the end of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; all this needs not hinder, but that thou ſhouldeſt look upon this Author, as a man of a moſt clear wit, &amp; Judgment and prize him as one that was full of knowledge, and experience in the Affaires of the World, and a moſt induſtrious, and ſtudious perſon.</p>
            <p>In the Third and laſt place thou art to take notice, as concerning this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> that we have therein dealt ſo fairely nd Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſly with our Author, as that we have perfectly and entirely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his own ſenſe unto him. Neither have we ſtopt his foul mouth where he hath either uſed ill Language toward any of the Proteſtant Princes, or caſt dirt into the faces of the firſt Reformers, <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> &amp;c. For to what end ſhould we falſifie our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, by making our Author more Civil then he had a mind to be? ſeeing we are never a whit the worſe for being ſo miſcalled by him; nor is he himſelf a jot the wiſer for uſing us ſo. And to ſay the Truth, we our ſelves take the ſame Liberty towards them: and therefore, for ought I ſee,

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the acquiring, and managing of every Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and Principality, there uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur three Cauſes; that is to ſay, <hi>God, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Occaſion:</hi> All which, being joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are called by the name of <hi>Fate;</hi> which is nothing elſe, but a concurrence of all the <hi>Cauſes,</hi> working by vertue of the <hi>Firſt.</hi> And hence alſo is <hi>Fortune</hi> ſprung, which is the Succeſſe of Earthly things, whether it be good, or evil; which, if it be rightly known, is called <hi>Prudence;</hi> but if otherwiſe, it is then called <hi>Fate, Fortune,</hi> or <hi>Chance.</hi> As for example, if a man find that which he had long ſought after, it is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Prudence:</hi> but if he light upon a thing which he did not ſeek after, nor knew where it was, it is called <hi>Chance,</hi> or <hi>Fortune.</hi> Among theſe three Cauſes, One ſometimes prevailes in the ruling
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118554:6"/>of things, more then Another; and perhaps more then the Other two. Yet notwithſtanding, if we will confeſſe the truth, they are all Three Politically concurring in the buſineſſe. Do but take notice of the Kingdome of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> wherein God was the Principal Agent; who, by ſending <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out the Other Two Cauſes. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was a perſon of extraordinary Wiſdome, and Knowledge, not onely in Divine, but in Humane things alſo: for he was well verſed in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and managed a War for King <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> whom he vanquiſhed in the War, and whoſe daughter alſo he took to Wife, as both <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> teſtifie. And yet for all this he deſpiſed not the advice of <hi>Jothro,</hi> his Father-in-law, touching the taking in of a certain number of perſons to aſſiſt him in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government over the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And indeed They, being ſore oppreſſed, and labouring under their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery, took Occaſion, by his means, of ſhaking that Yoak off their necks: whence they were inclined to hearken the more willingly to Him; and to follow him whither he would lead them; the Occaſion alſo, taken from the Wickedneſſe of thoſe of <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> concurring with their Inclinations. Beſides, the Great Monarch of all the Earth, God, of his own accord, and free grace, gave Wiſdom to his People; as he did likewiſe to the Apoſtles, and to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> which was alſo aſſiſted by <hi>Occaſion;</hi> which is nothing elſe, but to know how to make right uſe of the Time: whence followed the Diviſion of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, but the utter Subverſion of the <hi>Jewiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, where the Power of Man only appeared Outwardly, there was a concurrence and co-operation of the finger of God, though not ſo viſibly ſeen. And thus the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> for ſome ſecret Cauſes were poſſeſſed of the Monarchy of the World; which Cauſes notwithſtanding have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apparent: as we ſee in <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> whom God rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſpoyles of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe he had made uſe of Him againſt the ingrateful <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and againſt <hi>Tyre.</hi> And in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> God reproveth the King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for that, when by his aide his enemies had been ſlain and put to flight, He notwithſtanding had aſcribed all to his Own ſtrength. Now the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of this, was, the Wickedneſſe of the Nations, who were governed by no Prudence. In the Monarchy alſo of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the ſame
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118554:6"/>
                  <hi>Occaſion</hi> carried a great ſtroke in the buſineſſe, when as God (as it appears out of <hi>Daniel</hi>) came forth upon the ſtage, and raiſed up <hi>Arbaces,</hi> the Praefect of <hi>Media,</hi> who was a very wiſe man, againſt <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> who wallowed in all Luxury and Womaniſh delights. In the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy the Valour and Courage of <hi>Cyrus</hi> appeared, and <hi>Media,</hi> being deſtitute of a Succeſſour for the Kingdome, afforded him the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of ſhewing it: and God himſelf, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calling <hi>Cyrus,</hi> his <hi>Anointed,</hi> inſtructed him how he ſhould bring the Nations under his Yoake.</p>
               <p>Who makes any doubt of the Prudence and Wiſdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and knowes not, that the Diviſions of the <hi>Grecians</hi> at home, and the Looſeneſſe of Life that the Eaſtern Nations had at that time given themſelves up unto, adminiſtred unto him an <hi>Occaſion</hi> of making uſe of it. Wherein the Divine Power was moſt evidently manifeſted; for as much as, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> teſtifies, the Angel of the Kingdome of <hi>Greece</hi> laboured much in the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire alſo, Prudence, and Valour, did very much; but <hi>Italy's</hi> being divided into ſeveral Common-Wealths, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Factions among themſelves, were the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</hi> And commonly to that Part that diſſolves any great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, all the reſt of the Principalities of the World do incline. And certainly God himſelf was the chiefeſt Cauſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe of their Moral Virtues; as it is proved by St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his book <hi>De Civitate Dei.</hi> Yet no place doth more evidently ſhew, what <hi>Occaſion</hi> can do, then <hi>Sicily,</hi> at what time it called forth <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> againſt thoſe of <hi>Anjou;</hi> whence ſprang the Proverb of thoſe moſt famous <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers.</hi> Although it cannot be denied, but that he was aſſiſted very much in that Undertaking, not only by the Pope; but alſo by his own Innate Prudence. And truly, although Hiſtorians ſeldome make any mention at all of theſe Three <hi>Cauſes,</hi> yet the Books of the Kings of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the Succeſſions therein laid down before us, do ſufficiently confirm the ſame, and make it appear, that which way ſoever the <hi>Propheſies,</hi> and the <hi>Valour</hi> of the Perſons inclined, that way alſo did the <hi>Fortune</hi> of the Kingdom look.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſame <hi>Three Cauſes</hi> therefore have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy. For after that It had, by the Aſſiſtance of Almighty God, happily maintained War againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> for near 800. years ſpace together, It at length brought forth ſuch Valiant Commanders, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that being ſo fortified both by Strength and Prudence, and having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they then turned their Armes another way, and proceeded on to greater Undertakings. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being, as it were by Divine Inſtinct, aſſiſted by the Pope with a great Treaſure of <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Croiſados,</hi> and the King being alſo honoured by the Title of <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> It arrived to ſo great a reputation and glory of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> that the <hi>Genueſes</hi> were ſo much the more willingly and readily drawn in to their aſſiſtance in the making themſelves Maſters of the <hi>New World:</hi> And laſtly, it is moſt certain, that whileſt Wars were made with Launces, and Horſes, the <hi>Gaules, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> enlarged their Dominions; but when the Sword was the chief Weapon, the <hi>Romans</hi> then carried all afore them. But in after times, when <hi>Subtlety</hi> and <hi>Craft</hi> was of more Prevalence then <hi>Valour,</hi> and that <hi>Printing,</hi> and <hi>Guns</hi> were now found out, the Chief Power then fell into the hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who are a People that are both Induſtrious, Active, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and Subtle. For then did <hi>Occaſion</hi> joyn the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> with <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who had no Iſſue Male to ſucceed her: and at the ſame time alſo was added to him the Imperial Line of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> to which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, through defect of Iſſue Male in the <hi>Burgundian</hi> Family, there was added a very conſiderable Inheritance of many Lordſhips, and Provinces in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and in other places.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118554:7"/>
               <p>Then followes the Diſcovery of the <hi>New World,</hi> made by <hi>Chriſtophorus Columbus;</hi> and another acceſſion alſo, by the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> to <hi>Spain.</hi> All which rendred the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> both Illuſtrious, and Admirable, and alſo, beſides other things, made Her <hi>Lady of the Seas:</hi> to which Advantages was alſo added the Troubled Condition of the <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were at Variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about certain Points of Religion: by which meanes the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſo eaſily arrived to this height of Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it now is in.</p>
               <p>And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might grow more Powerful yet, and might attain to the Dominion of the Whole World, if he would but endeavour the Overthrow of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; as <hi>Alexander</hi> heretofore did of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> of the <hi>Carthaginean.</hi> For that Empire got up to this height, for the Sins of the Chriſtians; and the Angel of that People hath yet the upper hand. For while the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> have been at variance with the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> with the <hi>Genueſes,</hi> God hath raiſed up the <hi>Turks,</hi> and hath ſent them into both Empires; becauſe that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were too gently, and lightly puniſhed for their ſins by the <hi>Arabians, Tartars,</hi> and other forreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as I have already ſhewed in my <hi>Papal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Turk</hi> is the ſame to us at this day, who are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and divided by ſeveral Hereſies, that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were of old to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who by faction were divided into the Kingdomes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> except the Good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of <hi>Spain</hi> afford us his aſſiſtance; as I have elſewhere ſhewed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very evident, that neither <hi>Prudence</hi> alone, nor yet joyned with <hi>Occaſion,</hi> is ſufficient for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to, or governing a Kingdome; for as much as we know, that the Freedom of the <hi>Will</hi> conſiſts only in the <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf, and not either in <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>Paſſion.</hi> For it may ſo fall out, that a man may over night purpoſe the next morning to go to Sea, or to ſtudy, or to go to plow, or to do any other buſineſſe; and yet upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the falling of Rain, or unexpected tempeſtuous and foul weather may croſſe that ſo wiſe counſel of his; ſo that he muſt be forced to do, not according to his own determination, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as matters ſhall fall out. So that he that knowes how ſo to order his Counſels and Determinations, as that they ſhall alwaies be ſubordinate to the <hi>Superiour Cauſes,</hi> his affaires ſhall ſeldom fail of ſucceeding proſperouſly. Wiſemen therefore make it their buſineſſe to labour after the knowledge of theſe <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Cauſes,</hi> of God, and His Divine Will, on which the whole Chain, and <hi>Series</hi> of future things depends. And hence it is, that ſome have ſought for God in the Stars; who hath alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſome by the Stars; as namely, the <hi>Magi,</hi> or Wiſemen, at our Saviours Nativity. And perhaps a Rainy Morning may have done no hurt at all to this, or that Aſtrologer; becauſe they foreſaw this Rain, and ſo probably ordered their affaires accordingly, having regard to the Will of God herein; who, out of his ſingular goodneſſe, will be found there, where we ſeek him with a ſincere heart. Nay, when the buſineſſe ſo requires, he anſwereth even thoſe that do not ſeek him with a ſincere heart: as we ſee in <hi>Balaam,</hi> whom he anſwer'd perhaps, when he was not askt. And ſo likewiſe in King <hi>Saul,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> what the Event of things ſhould be, though he had by Witchcraft conſulted the Divel, and not <hi>Samuel:</hi> as <hi>Tho: Aquinas</hi> alſo is of opinion, in his 2.24.140. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alſo ought to believe, that the True God gave anſwer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118554:8"/>to the Diabolical Superſtitions of the <hi>Romans, Gracians,</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> by the Miniſtry of the peculiar Angel of each of theſe ſeveral Empires. For the Inevitable Decree of his Will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exalted, and again ſometimes depreſſed and clouded the Majeſty of thoſe Monarchies. Therefore the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and ſo likewiſe the <hi>Medes,</hi> whenſoever their own Wiſdom failed them, made their Invocations upon God by the Stars; as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did by their Oracles at <hi>Delphos,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> by their <hi>Auguries,</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> of <hi>Birds;</hi> and as the more Sound Philoſophers ſought Him in the Works of <hi>Nature:</hi> as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> alſo did in <hi>Numbers,</hi> which are as a certain Ray of Divinity, diſſeminated and diffuſed throughout the whole Univerſe. But much more rightly did the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſeek after him, by the <hi>Prophets</hi> which were ſent unto them. Which cuſtome of theirs the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo followed, when as the Archangel <hi>Michael</hi> had gone over from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to the State of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For in all probability we ought to believe, that when any Empire is overthrown, the Angel of that goeth over to the Conquerour. And this is a Secret which was not unknown to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who for this very reaſon would not have their <hi>Tutelar Angel</hi> to be known, to the end that he might not be invoked by other Nations. And therefore we may probably believe, that either the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> yeelded to that of <hi>Greece;</hi> or elſe, that He went over from the <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and ſo conſequently, that the Angel of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> does at this time fight for the <hi>Turks;</hi> or elſe, having removed his ſtation, ſtands now for <hi>Germany,</hi> and hath joyned himſelf to Her Angel. Now where there are the more of theſe <hi>Tutelar Angels,</hi> There there is the greater growth, and ſtronger confirmation of Power. And therefore, being inſtructed hereto out of the Scriptures, I affirm, that if at any time God appear to treat either favourably, or elſe contrarily with any Monarchy, we are to underſtand this in reference, not to that preſent Monarchy only, but to the ſucceeding alſo. For, unleſſe this were ſo, God ſhould not have revealed the Knowledge of Future things to his Church by the Prophets; which is an abſurd thing to believe: and it would alſo follow, that this Knowledge was to be ſought for by the Stars, or ſome other things. Which things, ſeeing they are partly alſo forbidden by the Pope, we are neceſſarily to believe, that all things are otherwiſe ſufficiently provided for.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:118554:9"/>
               <p>Whereſoever therefore God ſpeaks of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Empire, we are to underſtand it as ſaid alſo of the <hi>Perſian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> which in their turns ſucceeded It. And hence it is, that St. <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>Rome, Babylon.</hi> And ſo likewiſe what is ſaid of the Kingdom of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the ſame is to be underſtood alſo of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which hath received the Keyes of <hi>David,</hi> and the Name of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> according to that which is ſaid to the Angel of <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> Now <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is, <hi>Brotherly Love;</hi> as <hi>Roma,</hi> Rome, by turning the Letters backward, is <hi>Amor,</hi> Love. And God oftentimes threatens his Church; <hi>I will remove thy Candleſtick out of its place, unleſſe thou repent.</hi> For in like manner the Angel of God may be ſaid to remove from one Church to another, (as for example, from Heretical <hi>England,</hi> to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Boruſſia</hi>) as from one Kingdom to another. And ſo what is pronounced by <hi>Ezechiel, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Eſay,</hi> concerning the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> is ſometimes to be taken as ſpoken of the Prince of the Angels that fell from Heaven, and were caſt out of their Kingdom there. Where that alſo which is ſaid; <hi>How art thou fallen, O Lucifer!</hi> which is ſpoken of the King of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> is to be taken, as, by way of ſimilitude, ſpoken of his Succeſſors, and of the <hi>Aerial</hi> (ſo called) <hi>Empire</hi> of the Great <hi>Divel.</hi> For, both Empires, and all other Earthly things bear a ſimilitude to the Heavenly; as thoſe of the Sea do to them of the Land. Whence it is, that you have your <hi>Biſhop-fiſh,</hi> your <hi>Sea-calf,</hi> and the <hi>Calamary,</hi> or Sea-Clark: for as much as all of them have their dependance from the <hi>Prime Reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>Divine Idea,</hi> which is, the <hi>Eternal Word.</hi> Whence I ſeem to my ſelf to have found out a Key, by which I may find out a paſſage to the knowledge of the Original, Government, and end of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the <hi>Firſt Cauſe,</hi> which God hath laid open in the Prophets; and by which we may proceed on further, to diſcover the <hi>Prudence</hi> herein requiſite, and the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ought to lay hold on.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is evident, that the Propheſy concerning the end of the World, both according to Nature, and the Art of Policy, is ſhortly to be fulfilled; being that the Fixed Stars of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> have changed their places, and the Sun is now ten thouſand miles nearer to the Earth; and ſo many Eclipſes alſo appear, by reaſon of the Tranſpoſition of the Equinoctial Points; which, according to the Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> (though <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was Ignorant in Deeper matters, and was skilled only in <hi>Logick,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Quiddities,</hi> denies the ſame,) do foretel Grand Mutations, Theſe Exorbitances of the Heavenly Bodies, together with the Deluges, and devaſtations by Fire that have happened in all parts, as alſo the Changes that have happened in the greateſt Monarchies of the World, according to the Goſpel (wherewith <hi>Seneca</hi> alſo agrees in Opinion) are the evident ſigns, that the world is drawing to an end. For the Empire, or State of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> (and it is a thing very well worth our obſerving) hath laſted already 1600. yeares (and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;) Which number, being Compoſed of <hi>Sevens</hi> and <hi>Nines,</hi> is fatal to all Monarchies, as both <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> have written; and as may be gathered alſo out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where he ſpeaks of <hi>Jubiles,</hi> and <hi>Weeks;</hi> as likewiſe out of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Sabbatiſme</hi> of the Holy Land; and alſo out of the Art of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> touching the Cure of Fevers, and the difference of Complexions and Ages: and laſtly, from a paſſage of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar,</hi> who in an Epiſtle of his to his Nephew, rejoyceth very much, that he had eſcaped the Sixty Third year of his age; which year, ſeeing it is compoſed of nine Septenaries of years, is moſt dangerous and Fatal to people. And even God himſelf created all things in Number. Therefore this very time doth preſage Enlargement, or Impair, and Mutations in all things. We ſee alſo, that the Propheſy touching the Monarchies drawes now near an end, ſeeing that <hi>Balaam,</hi> as it is recorded by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118554:10"/>Num.</hi> Cap. 24, reckoning up the Monarchies, ſtops at that which concerns <hi>Italy,</hi> ſaying; <hi>They ſhall come in ſhips from</hi> Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly' <hi>and ſhall overcome the</hi> Aſſyrians, <hi>and in the end themſelves alſo ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> In which place he ſpeakes of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that it is neceſſary that it muſt be ingrafted into that of <hi>Italy.</hi> And conſequently alſo the Fate of <hi>Tyre</hi> may be underſtood of that of <hi>Spain:</hi> for as much as <hi>Carthage</hi> was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and by reaſon of the frequent voyages they made thither by Sea to and fro, it followed the manners and faſhions of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> And hence are the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſcended, who at firſt embracing and applying themſelves to the Manners, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties, &amp; Gods of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and afterwards becomming Chriſtians, were overwhelmed with all thoſe evils, with which God in his Prophets, <hi>Ezechiel, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> threatens <hi>Tyre.</hi> And beſides, they were very skilful alſo in Navigation, as thoſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> were. And if <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall imitate the pride of <hi>Tyre,</hi> by extolling it ſelf above the Church, as <hi>Tyre</hi> did, it ſhall ſuffer a ſorer deſtruction then that did, neither ſhall it ever enlarge the bounds of its Empire. Nevertheleſſe before the end of the World, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being joyned in amity with the Pope, ſhall live in a more happy condition, and ſhall raign ſecurely and peaceably, holding Correſpondence with the Church, and courting the Pope and the Cardinals, like the Daughter of <hi>Tyre,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi>) with Gifts: neither yet ſhall he arrive to that Height of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy</hi> which he had aſpired unto. But this is a buſineſſe to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſecretly, and not to be publiſhed openly to the World. And as concerning the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Ambition, I affirm, that while he complies with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he ſhall be humbled, for as much as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith; <hi>Onus Jumentorum Auſtri, the burden of the beaſts of the South;</hi> intimating, that He ſhall effect none of thoſe things which I ſhall hereafter touch upon; that is, raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the condition he now doth; but ſhall be deſtroyed, as one overwhelmed by a Wall falling on him, like as <hi>Tyre</hi> was. And hence conſidering with himſelf the evill likely to befal him, he ſhall at length lift up his head, when he ſhall have called to remembrance, that after that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was once inſerted into that of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>New World</hi> was preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by his Agents, and he had thence returns of ſhips laden with gold, which are <hi>Jumenta Auſtriae,</hi> thoſe Beaſts of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> &amp;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118554:10"/>beſides, that the Title of Monarchy, and this ſo great Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his began under <hi>Charles</hi> V. had he but known as well how to keep what he had got, as he knew how to get it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that neither in his time <hi>Fate</hi> anſwered the expectation of <hi>Spain</hi> we muſt therefore ſearch the Scriptures more diligently, that we may diſcover when that time is to be; as a certain Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician ſaid, and as we alſo, God willing, ſhall ſhew; that we may attain to that which they drive at. But I ſay, that the end of Monarchies is now come, and that we are now come to that Age, wherein all things are to be in ſubjection to the Saints, and to the Church; which is to be, after the end of the four Monarchies, and the death of Antichriſt, who ſhall continue for the ſpace of three Weeks and a half, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lactantius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Victorianus,</hi> S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Joachimus Abbas, Dante, Petrarch,</hi> and ſome others, both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Philoſophers, Prophets, and Poets; as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewed. <hi>Daniels</hi> Image alſo is fallen to the ground; ſo likewiſe the <hi>Four Beaſts,</hi> the <hi>Three Weekes,</hi> and the <hi>Twelve Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered wings of the Eagle,</hi> ſpoken of in the ſecond Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> are now all at an end, together with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; which ſeeing according to him, it is the ſame with that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it is by ſucceſſion divided into Three Heads; Firſt, into the <hi>Right Head,</hi> which is the Weſtern, or <hi>German</hi> Empire; then into the <hi>Left Head,</hi> that is, the Eaſtern Empire of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens;</hi> and the Middle one, which is that of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For in the Scriptures the <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>Left</hi> hand of the World is otherwiſe aſſigned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> then it is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his works. Now amongſt theſe three Heads the Left, as the ſame Prophet teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, hath devoured the middlemoſt; that is to ſay, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire hath deſtroyed the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> to wit, in the time of <hi>Mahumet</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi> It now remaines, according to the ſame Prophet, that the <hi>Right</hi> Head, or <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, devour the Left, that is, that of the <hi>Turks.</hi> And hereto agrees the Aſtrology of <hi>Torquatus,</hi> which ſaith, that <hi>Hungary</hi> threatens deſtruction to the <hi>Turk;</hi> and that the Empire of the Moon ſhall be divided betwixt Two Sons of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour, that ſhall be the Fifteenth Emperour of <hi>Turkey;</hi> at which time the Moon ſhall be bowed into two Horns. And this ſtar is indeed a very terrible one, and will make it appear, that he that ſhall conquer, and ſubdue the <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> ſhall be Lord of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118554:11"/>whole Earth. The Houſe of <hi>Spain</hi> then can never attaine to any great Monarchy, according to Fate; but only by the adhering to <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which is the <hi>German,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Right Head.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> therefore is to uſe his utmoſt endeavour, that he may be choſen Emperour: ſeeing that not only God, but even Human Prudence alſo may inform us, that by that meanes he may attain to what ever his heart can wiſh. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of which thing appeared plain enough in <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, King of <hi>Spain:</hi> who being alſo Emperour, and being aſſiſted with the whole power of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> overcame thoſe of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> and conquered all <hi>Germany:</hi> in ſo much that <hi>Solyman,</hi> ſeeing the proſperous Fortune of this Prince, had good Cauſe to ſay, that it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to take heed of <hi>Charles:</hi> neither would he, though he were ſtronger then He, fight with Him under the Walls of <hi>Vienna.</hi> We ſee therefore that which way the <hi>Fates</hi> incline, the ſame alſo goes all the reſt of the <hi>Fortune;</hi> and ſo on the other ſide, all things muſt needs be ſucceſſeleſſe, that are taken in hand under a <hi>Reluctant Fate.</hi> I ſhall here alſo open another Myſtery, namely, that all Empires, according to the Propheſy of <hi>Noah,</hi> do deſcend from the Sons of <hi>Japhet; God ſhall enlarge</hi> Japhet, <hi>and he ſhall dwell in the tents of</hi> Sem, <hi>and</hi> Cham <hi>ſhall be his Servant.</hi> And from <hi>Cham</hi> are to deſcend none but <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Tyrants,</hi> who are indeed <hi>Slaves;</hi> as I have elſewhere proved. Wherefore the <hi>Turkiſh Empire</hi> comes from <hi>Japhet,</hi> by <hi>Magog,</hi> and as to the <hi>Law,</hi> from <hi>Sem</hi> by the Line of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> from whom <hi>Mahumet</hi> deſcended; as it hath allwaies been obſerved to fall out, that the Northern People which are fierce, and by the armes of <hi>Japhet</hi> ſtill Victorious, have yet received Lawes and Rules from the wiſer Southern People, who were the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Sem.</hi> And yet the Empire ſometimes hath otherwiſe had a ſucceſſion of Tyrants alſo, who have deſcended from <hi>Cham,</hi> though by the intervention of the <hi>German,</hi> who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Japhet;</hi> as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> himſelf derives his Line from <hi>Japhet</hi> by <hi>Tubal:</hi> like as concerning the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtianity doth derive it ſelf from <hi>Sem,</hi> in reſpect of Chriſt, who is a true <hi>Sem,</hi> by the Line of <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Dominion</hi> was promiſed to <hi>Japhet,</hi> it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth chiefly to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are more nearly, and by a firmer alliance deſcended from the Law-giver, then the <hi>Turks;</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:118554:11"/>and their Victorie drives on to this end, that they may dwell in the Houſe of <hi>Sem,</hi> ſeeing that they poſſeſſe the Greateſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Inveſtiture of the Pope, who is deſcended from <hi>Sem:</hi> Of whom this is no fit occaſion to ſay any more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I willingly would do ſo, and indeed ought. I ſhall only add here, that they cannot, according to <hi>Fate,</hi> come to be Lords of all, unleſſe they become the Deliverers of the Church, and ſet it free from out of the hands of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that is to ſay, of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Upon this account they conquered the <hi>Moores,</hi> God beſtowing upon them ſo great an Empire as their reward. Now it is evident, that the Church is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as long as it is <hi>Militant:</hi> and I have formerly ſhewed elſewhere, that it doth yet retain the dayes of <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> and the moneths of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> which were theirs of the <hi>Roman Babylon;</hi> and the Church now ſuffers moſt grievous Perſecutions under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Infidels, both in <hi>Africk, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Germany, France, England,</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi> This diſcourſe therefore is to be liſtened unto with attentive eares, becauſe that all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Affaires were a Type and figure of thoſe of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He therefore, that ſhall deliver the Church out of theſe evills, ſhall become the Univerſal Monarch; becauſe He ſhall perform the Office of the Chriſtain <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom God ſhall raiſe up, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the whole World, to reſtore <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to remove their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and to build a temple to the God of Heaven and Earth, wherein ſhall be ſet up the <hi>Continual Sacrifice,</hi> as is foretold by <hi>Daniel, Eſay,</hi> and <hi>Eſdras. Cyrus</hi> alſo was of the Linage of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> by the <hi>Medes;</hi> and notwithſtanding that the <hi>Turk</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of the ſame ſtock alſo, yet ſhall He not perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, becauſe that He is become an Enemy, by ſetting up another Contrary Law. The <hi>French</hi> in the time of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> arrogated this Office to themſelves; who by their often delivering the Pope out of the hands of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and the <hi>Goths,</hi> arrived to ſo great power, that they became formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all: and the ſaid <hi>Charlemagne</hi> might have come to have been Univerſal Monarch of the World, had not his ſons been at Variance among themſelves, but had managed their Empire rightly, and as they ought to have done.</p>
               <p>But the diſcords that were betwixt the Chriſtians, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hereſy, raigning at this day, broke the neck of the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118554:12"/>Empire; at leaſt took away from it all hope of ever arriving to the height of ſo much greatneſſe. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by being continually rooting out of the <hi>Moors,</hi> became powerful; but contrariwiſe <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe it deſerted the Pope, and adhered to <hi>Arrius, Sabellius,</hi> and others, came to deſtruction. The <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo have by the Popes meanes arrived to a great height, becauſe that they aſſiſted him againſt <hi>Frederick.</hi> So that it is manifeſt, that he that ſhall take any enterprize in hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Favourable Fate,</hi> ſhall have all happy ſucceſſe therein; but on the contrary, he that ſhall ruſh on upon any undertaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Croſſe, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilling Fate,</hi> ſhall find the Event alſo quite contrary to his deſires. Which may alſo be demonſtrated out of Reaſons of Policy. For, he that maintaines the Popes Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, maintaines the Univerſal Right of all Chriſtendom, which depends upon the Pope. For this Cauſe is accounted both a Juſt, and a Religious one, and therefore all men will take it up. And the Opinion alſo of Religion overcomes all other cauſes; as we have already ſhewed elſewhere, and ſhall further ſhew hereafter. Add hereto, that the Pope is the Univerſal Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and Judge of all things; to whom all people have their recourſe, and yeild obedience to him, as to their God, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; as on the contrary the <hi>Sweden, Saxon,</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan</hi> Princes, as being enemies to, and Stubborn oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Him, are rejected, and deſerted by them. Therefore the Office of <hi>Cyrus</hi> belongs to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who, being now honoured by the Pope with the Title of <hi>The Catholick King,</hi> may eaſily arrive to the Principality of the whole World; and we ſee that he hath already followed his Footſteeps, in having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Church heretofore out of the hands of the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Granado</hi> as he hath lately done from the Hereticks of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> and He maintaines beſides with yearly Revenues ſo many Biſhops, Cardinals, and Monaſteries: and he hath alſo ſetled the <hi>Daily Sacrifice</hi> throughout the whole World: for as much as that every half hour, &amp; indeed continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Maſſe is celebrated throughout his Empire: within the compaſſe whereof the <hi>Roman Papacy,</hi> the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple are contained. Neither doth it ever Sleep in his Empire. For ſeeing that the Sun being carried about in his Courſe from <hi>Spain,</hi> to <hi>Braſile,</hi> the Straites of <hi>Magellan,</hi> the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippine</hi> Iſlands, <hi>Japan, China, Archipelagus Lazari, Calecut, Goa, Bengala, Ormus,</hi> the <hi>Cape of Good hope,</hi> the Sea Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118554:12"/>and the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> till it comes back again to the ſame <hi>Spain,</hi> there is no hour of the day but it enlightens ſome part of His Dominions; there is no queſtion but that there are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Sacrifices offered up to the God of Heaven and Earth. It is certainly a very wonderful thing, and a moſt evident Sign, that this Kingdom of his is diffuſed to a vaſt diſtance, wherein Prayers are continually offered up for the Church, and the King, together with what <hi>Stupendous Sacrifice;</hi> which, both according to the Truth, and the Opinion of Men, is of no mean Efficacy in the hearts of his Subjects. Whence I affirm, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> following the Order of Things, and by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Rules of <hi>Prudence,</hi> together with <hi>Occaſion,</hi> may bring all things under his Obedience; as it ſhall be made appear out of the Reaſons hereafter following. For this is already evident, that he engages in the ſame Intereſt with that of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, which is the ſame with that of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the ſame with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or the Empire of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and ſo conſequently of that of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> And he ſhall have the Aſſiſtance of many ſeveral Angels, as that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and of <hi>Michael;</hi> and afterwards all things ſhall be delivered into the hands of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog;</hi> But the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhall overcome: and then ſhall Chriſt come to Judge the World. And then ſhall the end be. But the Eclipſe, and the Great Conjunction in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> which is the <hi>Conſtellation</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> will diſcover many ſecrets, when I ſhall have opportunity to diſcourſe of the ſame.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as <hi>Prudence</hi> is required in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Humane things, (which is a Cauſe adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Fate,</hi> conſiſting of an infinite number of <hi>Joynt Cauſes,</hi> acting by vertue of the <hi>Prime Cauſe),</hi> ſo eſpecially it is neceſſary in the manageing of an Empire: by It the whole World is governed; and it is diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by God through all the Univerſe. For <hi>Nature</hi> is an Intrinſecal, <hi>Divine Art:</hi> and whoſoever ſhall follow <hi>Nature</hi> as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118554:13"/>his guide, he is wiſe; which appears evidently in Plants, Ants, Bees, Cranes, and the very Fiſhes themſelves; which ſmall Creatures do oftentimes afford Inſtruction even to Men, in the managing of their Dominions. Whence we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>Prudence</hi> is a different thing from <hi>Craft;</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome, <hi>Ratio Statuum regendorum,</hi> the Reaſon, or Rule of State-Government. For <hi>Prudence</hi> is agreeable to the <hi>Prime Cauſe,</hi> namely God; whence it ſearcheth into Propheſies, and Divine Sciences, to the end that it may attain to the knowledge of things to come. But <hi>Craft</hi> ſeeks after its own ſatisfaction, and Pleaſure only, and is Pleaſed with nothing more then the ſubtlety of its own Wit; Which notwithſtanding, though falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, calls it ſelf <hi>Wiſedom;</hi> according to what was ſpoken by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh: Venite, Sapienter opprimamus eos;</hi> Come on, let us deal wiſely with them. <hi>Prudence</hi> is Magnanimous, and Propoſeth to it ſelf onely ſuch things as are truly of moſt difficult Atchievement. But <hi>Craft</hi> is puſillanimous, and ſneaking: yet that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Magnanimous, It puts on the garbe of Pride, and would fain ſeem to reach at high matters, but alwayes out of the way of Vertue; and it flies at mean things, ſuch as are ſcarcely of any value at all. <hi>Prudence</hi> is addicted to Clemency, and Truth; but <hi>Craft</hi> is Cruel, and given to Flattery. Whence the <hi>Crafty</hi> Princes ſaying is, that the <hi>Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Valiant</hi> are to be made out of the way, leaſt happily they ſhould wreſt the Scepter out of his Hand. <hi>Quicquid excelſum eſt, cadat;</hi> was the ſaying of <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Periander;</hi> whatſoever is High, you muſt down with it. But <hi>Prudence</hi> makes uſe of the Aſſiſtance of ſuch, for the eſtabliſhing of its own Kingdom: as we read that the <hi>Honeſt Pharaoh,</hi> (who differed much, from the other <hi>Crafty Pharaoh</hi>) made uſe of the ſervice of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> And this is the Rule alſo of the Pope, who is wont to advance ſuch as are Wiſe, and Learned perſons, to the dignity of being Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. The <hi>Crafty</hi> Prince ſtudieth how to find out deceitful tricks, and fraudulent deviſes, to impoſe upon his Subjects: But the <hi>Prudent</hi> looks after advantageous, and uſeful Arts, and ſuch as may encourage his people, and make every one of them the more ready for the diſcharge of his duty: as we ſee in <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who, that he might render Himſelf the more Venerable, and worthy of eſteem to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> found out for them, and eſtabliſhed a Form of Religion, and Sacred Rites, that ſo by this meanes He might the better make them contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118554:13"/>within the Bounds of their Duty and Obedience. <hi>Prudence</hi> is a Vertue that becometh Kings and Emperours; but <hi>Craft</hi> is fit only for <hi>Davuſſes,</hi> and <hi>Slaves. Prudence,</hi> while it loſeth, is a gainer; (as we may obſerve of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and from the practiſe of the Pope at this day,) and the more inwardly we are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, the more fervently we love it; Whereas <hi>Craft,</hi> while it gaines, is a loſer; and the better it is known, and ſeen into, the more it is hated. As wee ſee it was in that wicked Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of <hi>Machiavell, Caeſar Borgia,</hi> who by his <hi>Crafty,</hi> Politique Tricks, loſt the Principality of <hi>Flaminia,</hi> (which is now called <hi>Romania;</hi>) and in <hi>Tiberius</hi> alſo, and <hi>Nero:</hi> who by their Fineſſes, and <hi>Crafty</hi> deſignments darkened, and caſt a cloud over the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which had been rendred ſo reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Illuſtrious before, by the <hi>Prudent Management</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar.</hi> The <hi>Prudent</hi> Prince propoſeth to himſelf the good of the Publique only; but the <hi>Crafty</hi> looks onely after his own Private gain. The <hi>Prudent,</hi> that he may accompliſh his deſires, ſhewes himſelf <hi>Valiant</hi> even almoſt to Raſh adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: as <hi>Columbus, Caeſar, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> did: and withall <hi>Liberal</hi> alſo, even to a ſeeming degree of Prodigality, and laſtly <hi>Juſt,</hi> yet with a Moderation in his Severity. And therefore when he gets any thing, he beſtowes it all upon his Subjects, that ſo he may oblige them to him by Benefits, and may make them faithful and true unto Him. Neither yet is He ſo free in his gifts to them, as that they ſhall never have need of him more. But when He hath once attained to what he laboured for, he then becomes more thrifty, and looks about him, and conſiders how he may maintain his own State; leaſt otherwiſe He ſhould be forced by the neceſſity of impoſing upon his Subjects Unuſual Taxes, to gain their ill will, and loſe their Affections; which was <hi>Caligula's</hi> Caſe heretofore; who, after that he had in riotous courſes fool'd away all his own Eſtate, was neceſſitated preſently to ſnatch away other mens. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, whoſoever takes in hand any high and difficult At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, under the Aſſiſtance of a <hi>Favourable Fate,</hi> he muſt neceſſarily be Couragious and daring; and indeed every Great, and Memorable Enterpriſe requireth a certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Courage;</hi> which yet in caſe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſhould not be anſwerable, would be called Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:118554:14"/>
               <p>As for example, it was accounted a <hi>Bold undertaking</hi> in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus,</hi> to go in ſearch of a <hi>New World;</hi> but plain <hi>Raſhneſſe</hi> in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes:</hi> only becauſe the one eſcaped ſafe; but the other ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhipwrack. But when a Prince hath effected his deſires, he muſt then have an eye to the uncertainty of Fortune, and muſt therefore take heed how he is too bold and daring; the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Counſel being neglected by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift, was the cauſe of bringing to nothing all that he had atchieved before in <hi>Germany;</hi> for he did not take the ſame wiſe Courſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what he had gotten, as he had done in the getting of it. And the caſe was the ſame alſo with the great <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> And then again, in war there is a neceſſity of uſing ſeverity, that ſo the Souldiers may all be kept to their ſeveral duties; and beſides, thoſe that perform any Signall peices of Service, are to be rewarded accordingly: which Courſe unleſſe it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they will begin to ſpurn at the Government, and break out into ſeditious wayes: (as <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Army did, when it was in <hi>Germany</hi>) and will fall to an inſolent courſe of Plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and robbing: and ſo by theſe meanes will bring the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they had gotten before, to nothing: as it happened to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radinus</hi> the <hi>Swevian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore after any Conqueſt gotten over a Kingdom, the Conquerour muſt modeſtly uſe his Victory, and endeavour to pleaſe the People; For otherwiſe he will alienate their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from himſelf; and they will be apt upon all occaſions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite in his Enemies to fall upon him; as it happened to <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> after the Firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War; and to <hi>Aecolinus,</hi> againſt whom his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Citizens of <hi>Padua,</hi> ſhut their gates; as likewiſe to <hi>Nero,</hi> who, though Prince of it, was yet called, <hi>The Enemy of his Country.</hi> And although many <hi>Crafty</hi> Practiſes are now in uſe among Princes, for the keeping of their Subjects in due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; yet I dare boldly affirm, that they will in the end prove deſtructive to thoſe Princes. For we ſee that <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that <hi>Grand Artifex</hi> of, <hi>Subtleties</hi> and <hi>Craft,</hi> was miſerably hated by his Subjects, and ſo led a very ſad life, becauſe he found he was not loved by any body, ſo that he was fain to put ſome or other every day to death, as contemners of his Majeſty, and ſo to be ever of a troubled, diſquieted mind: which certainly may better be called a Death, then a life. Therefore the higheſt,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118554:14"/>and moſt advantageous <hi>Craft</hi> that a Prince can make uſe of, is, to ſhew himſelf Beneficent, Religious, and Liberall toward his Subjects; yet this in ſo moderate a way, as that by this means he give them not occaſion to deſpiſe him: as happened to Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               <p>But let us now proceed to thoſe things, that more Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concern <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I have before ſhewed by Divine Reaſons, that there can be no Univerſal Monarchy among the Chriſtians expected, ſave that of the Pope: and have alſo declared how he is to be dealt withal; ſo I ſhall now prove by Reaſons of Policy, that there can be no Monarch in the Chriſtian World, unleſſe he have his dependance upon the Pope. For certainly, what Prince ſoever hath any other that is ſuperiour to Him, though in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion onely, and not in point of Armes, as the <hi>Pope</hi> is, he can never attain to an Univerſal Monarchy. For, whatſoever. He ſhall take in hand, it will be ſucceſſeleſſe; and he ſhall be, as it were, cruſhed in pieces by the ſuperiour. For, All Religions, as well the Falſe, as the True, do prevail, and are Victorious, when they have once taken root in the Minds of men; upon which onely depend both their Tongues and Armes, which are the onely Inſtruments of attaining Dominion. Thus we ſee that <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> when any were created Conſuls, if the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex Maximus</hi> came and ſayd, <hi>They were not created Rightly,</hi> they were preſently by him put by: and ſo, whenſoever he was to enter into a fight, if the <hi>Augurs</hi> ſaid, that <hi>The Pullen would not eat their meat,</hi> he forbare to go on; and did onely what he was directed to by their <hi>Omen.</hi> And therefore when the ſame <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had fallen upon a reſolution of making himſelf A Monarch, he oppoſed <hi>Cato</hi> as much as poſſibly he could, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all poſſible meanes to be choſen to be the <hi>Pontifex Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus.</hi> Which when he had once attained unto, he acted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and took upon himſelf all the Martiall Offices that were to be adminiſtred by the ſword, that ſo he might drive on his deſigns the more ſecurely; and withal by his gifts oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Souldiery ſo to him, as that they refuſed not to bear arms for Him, even againſt their Country, and to aſſiſt him in his deſigns of changing the Government of the ſtate. So in like manner <hi>Cyrus</hi> would be called by the Title of Gods <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary,</hi> that ſo no Prophet might pretend to be greater then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118554:15"/>Himſelf. And <hi>Alexander</hi> the great would be accounted the ſon <hi>of Jupiter Ammon,</hi> for the very ſame reaſon. It is alſo very evident, that no Monarchy in the Chriſtian World hath arrived to the Height, by reaſon of the obedience which is due to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he aſpired to a Monarchy, brought in firſt a <hi>New Religion</hi> which was quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what was before. For <hi>Armes</hi> cannot effect any thing againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> if they be overmaſter'd by another more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful <hi>Religion,</hi> though a worſe, if ſo be it be but entertained by the People. For as much therefore as there is no more powerful <hi>Religion</hi> found in the World, then that of the <hi>Roman Chriſtian,</hi> it is evident that neither <hi>Spain,</hi> nor <hi>France</hi> can attain to any greater Dignity then It. And hence it was, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, when he had a deſign upon the Univerſal Monarchy of the World, took upon himſelf the Title of being <hi>The Protector of the Pope:</hi> and indeed ſo long as he ſtood up in a defence of Chriſtianitie, he became Great.</p>
               <p>If the King of <hi>Spain</hi> therefore do in like manner aſpire to the ſame Height, it is neceſſary that he frame ſome <hi>New Religion;</hi> but this, neither God nor Reaſon permits him to do. For Firſt, this is never to be done, but in the very Infancy, and beginning of a Kingdom; as you may ſee in the examples of <hi>Mahomet, Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> for otherwiſe he muſt needs come to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, by changing the <hi>Auſpicia Regni,</hi> the <hi>Fortune</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as I may call it, whoſe dependance is from <hi>Faith in Chriſt;</hi> and then the People will immediately betake themſelves to their Armes, and revolt from him. Neither indeed have any Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archies been either more certainly, or more miſerably brought to deſtruction, then when they have changed their Religion; as is teſtified by Hiſtories. And then again, the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes of Chriſtendom would joyn their whole ſtrengths together, and would in a very litle time root him out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples, Millan,</hi> and conſequently alſo of the <hi>New World,</hi> &amp; the reſt of his Dominions. And although theſe things were not done to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII of <hi>England,</hi> nor yet to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> becauſe their Territories were encompaſſed within ſmall, though well fortified Bounds; yet for all that did they fail of ſucceſſion, and ſo their States went away from them. And we have examples hereof alſo in <hi>Jeroboam, Jehu, Julian</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:118554:15"/>the Apoſtate, and others; who, for having changed their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, incurred the hatred of their People, and brought deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>Unleſſe we ſhall ſay, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power at all in Temporal things, nor is any whit above either any other of the Biſhops, or theirs Surrogates or Chaplains, in Authority or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; which is evidently contradictory to Gods Ordination, by which He hath been conſtituted a <hi>Regal Prieſt,</hi> and hath been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with both the Swords, as well the Civill as the Spiritual. For, were it otherwiſe, Chriſt ſhould be a very mean Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and ſhould be leſſe then <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who was both King, and Prieſt together; which addeth both the greater Majeſty, as well as ſecurity to any Kingdom; as I have proved in my Treatiſe Touching <hi>Monarchy,</hi> againſt <hi>Dante,</hi> who, looking only upon the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> allowes to the <hi>Pope</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Spiritualties,</hi> and <hi>Tithes</hi> only. And which is more, this impugnes alſo all <hi>Reaſons of Policy;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> can never want thoſe that will take up Armes in His defence, (in caſe He ſhould not be able to defend Himſelf) and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by being moved thereunto through Zeal to Religion; as the Counteſſe <hi>Matilda</hi> did againſt the Emperour <hi>Henry;</hi> or elſe out of Emulation, or ſome intereſt of Faction; as it was in the Caſe of the <hi>Venetians</hi> making war upon the Emperour <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> whom they compelled to kiſſe the <hi>Popes</hi> Foot: or for both theſe reaſons; as when King <hi>Pipin,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great took up Armes in aſſiſtance of the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and others who waged war againſt him. Thus we ſee that the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Empire came to be deſtroyed for the Apoſtaſy of <hi>Julian,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as all the <hi>Fredericks, Henries,</hi> and other Kings alſo of <hi>Naples</hi> ſuffered for the ſame Cauſe, as often as they deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Obedience to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And certainly the Opinion, and Beliefe which hath prevailed upon the Minds of all People touching the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> is of very great force; and moves them to defend It to the utmoſt of their power; ſo that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Pope</hi> hath excommunicated any Prince, He doth at the ſame inſtant ruine him alſo. Do but obſerve, I pray you, to what ſtate <hi>Ferraria</hi> is reduced at this day. But we have diſcourſed more copiouſly of this in the Treatiſe of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>It is, laſtly, againſt all Policy too; for the <hi>Pope</hi> withholds the reſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118554:16"/>of the Princes of Chriſtendom from invading <hi>Spain;</hi> as he doth the King of <hi>Spain</hi> from invading them, by continually compoſing their differences; in like manner as he divided <hi>India</hi> betwixt the <hi>Portugals</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and thus hath ſeveral times made peace betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>French, Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies;</hi> and ſo likewiſe betwixt <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Florence;</hi> which yet he would not ſo eaſily be able to do, by the meer Reverence they bear to Religion. For here in theſe Caſes they have an eye as well to the force of Armes, as to Religion; for He that is in the wrong Cauſe, may juſtly ſuſpect the <hi>Popes</hi> joyning of his ſtrength to that of his Antagoniſt; and ſo for this reaſon he will the more readily obey the Popes Injunction; as I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red formerly in the forementioned Treatiſe. And the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> if he but declare himſelf for, and ſtand up in the defence of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſhall be ſure to have alwayes the aſſiſtance of His Forces at his devotion at any time, which will be a good means of confirming his Kingdom to him. And therefore I conceave it very neceſſary, according to the <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would arrive to an Univerſal Monarchy, He muſt declare himſelf publiquely to have his dependance from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and command it to be publiſhed all abroad throughout the World, that himſelf is the <hi>Cyrus</hi> that was before typified, and the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, that is, the Univerſal Monarch of the World, declaring this his Monarchy by his Religious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and pious Actions; and paſſing alſo by many litigious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which he hath with the <hi>Pope;</hi> and dwelling in the Tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> making it appear to all the World, that He is the Chief <hi>Defender of Chriſtian Religion, that depends wholly upon the Pope of Rome;</hi> calling together alſo the Chriſtian Princes, to conſult about the recovery of thoſe Countreys they have loſt, and are at this day in the hands of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> and He muſt proceed to the cauſing of ſuch to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, as ſhall deny their aſſiſtance herein; and laſtly he muſt alſo take care that Pious, and diligent Preachers be ſent abroad into the World to promote this buſineſſe. For the Plain truth of it is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> picks quarrels ſometimes with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for no other reaſon, but only becauſe he is afraid, that in caſe he ſhould ſubdue the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> hee would then make Him only as his Chaplain. And this is the reaſon, why He deſires, that they ſhould alwayes be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118554:16"/>at variance one with another; that ſo, in caſe either of them ſhould fall off from Him, by reaſon either of Apoſtaſy, or ſome quarrel or other, He might have the other to aſſiſt him. And this is the reaſon why he ſtirred up the Weſtern Empire againſt the Eaſtern; onely becauſe they had forſaken their former Religion, &amp; had had many Claſhings with the Pope about It. But now if King <hi>Philip</hi> will but do that which is his duty, (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared) and will but give way to the <hi>Pope</hi> in ſome things which he pretends His Right, and will beſides ſend ſome Biſhops, and Cardinals into the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, and to the <hi>New world,</hi> to diſpoſe of, and order things there; he will by this meanes both free the <hi>Pope</hi> from this ſuſpition, and ſhall withall effect his own deſires: ſeeing that it is evident, that the Pope, by his <hi>Indulgencies</hi> and <hi>Croysados,</hi> brings him in more mony, then thoſe Dignities which he beſtowes upon Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, do yearly ſtand him in; ſo that he will be a gainer in that, wherein he is affraid moſt of being a loſer. And this he would quickly confeſſe, if he would but cauſe it to be publickly preached and proclaimed abroad, that the end of the World is at hand, and that the time is now come, when there is to be <hi>one Sheepfold,</hi> under <hi>One Shepheard,</hi> that is, the <hi>Pope;</hi> and that Himſelf is another <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whoſe Office it is to ſee theſe things brought about, and to gather all the Flock into that One <hi>Sheepfold;</hi> and that what Nation, or Kingdom ſoever ſhall refuſe to yield Him obedience, ſhall be brought to deſtruction; and many other things, which I had rather deliver by ſpeech, then writing.</p>
               <p>There are many Cauſes to be laid open, whereby the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well in reference to <hi>Prudence, Power,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy,</hi> may be rendered Admired by all the World. For, whether all theſe things do joyntly incline, there neceſſarily muſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire follow. And ſeeing that this height of Dignity is to be atained unto, under the Fortune, and Intereſt of the Empire of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is now called the <hi>German</hi> Empire; there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould labour by all poſſible meanes to reduce that Empire under his power. And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to effect this he muſt deal with the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the moſt direful Curſes that may be, againſt the Three <hi>Proteſtant Electors</hi> of the Empire; threatning them withall, that unleſſe they return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> He will deprive them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118554:17"/>of their Electoral Dignity, which they received from the <hi>Pope</hi> onely; and that feeing they now affirm, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> they ſhall be convinced out of their own words, and made to ſee, that themſelves are <hi>Antichriſtians:</hi> and that therefore they ought of themſelves to lay down that Dignity of theirs, unleſſe they will recant, and again admit of the <hi>Catholick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</hi> And to this end the <hi>French, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being firſt all reconciled and made friends by the <hi>Pope,</hi> are to joyn their whole Forces together, and to go againſt them; (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would much promote this buſineſſe) and having overcome them, they muſt utterly extirpate all the Sects that have raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, and ſend in new Colonies into their places. And this expedition is ſo eaſy a one, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might have been able to have effected it alone. But whereas the <hi>Free Cities</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> do in no wiſe deſire to hear of any ſuch Empire, or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy,</hi> leſt ſo They ſhould be reduced into their ancient ſervitude again; and alſo becauſe they are very ſlow in their Deliberations, and as ſlow alſo in the Execution of them; it would therefore very much advance this deſign, if the reſt of the Princes of Chriſtendom, joyning their Forces together, would ſuddenly fall upon them; Which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when it ſhould be over, the moſt Potent, or moſt Forward of thoſe Princes ſhould be choſen <hi>Electors</hi> of the Empire, by the Apoſtolical Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whether they were <hi>Germans, Italians,</hi> or <hi>Spaniards;</hi> or elſe they might be choſen by <hi>Lot,</hi> when the moſt potent of the Chriſtian Princes ſhould meet together in a Solemne Convention. And although the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Empire of Chriſtendom might eaſily by theſe meanes be tranſlated to <hi>Spain;</hi> yet it would be ſufficient to do the buſineſſe, if but any one King of <hi>Spain</hi> would ſo order the matter, that Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might be but choſen Emperour; who ſhould then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately march into <hi>Germany</hi> with a good Army, and ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſubdue it, while it is at ſo great diſcord and variance within it ſelf, both in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of <hi>State.</hi> And this Expedition he ought ſpeedily to go upon, and that under a Pretext of marching for <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things I ſay, that all People might take notice, how much it concerns the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the attaining to the Empire of the World by the means of the <hi>Pope.</hi>

He ought beſides to oblige the Chief of the Clergy to himſelf by the moſt commodious Arts that he can; as namely, by ſending into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and the like ſuſpected places, Cardinals, and Biſhops, to be Governours there; for the People would much more readily and chearfully obey the commands of ſuch, then they will the ſeverity of the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and ſuch Prelates would alſo adhere more to Them. Nevertheleſſe in the mean time they ought to have as ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to them, ſome Military Commanders, with Forces too. And beſides, He ought, by the <hi>Popes</hi> conſent too, to ſend abroad ſuch Cardinals, as are either <hi>Spaniards</hi> born, or at leaſt of the <hi>Spaniſh Faction,</hi> into the parts of the <hi>New world,</hi> and all other far remote Places, to rule and exerciſe Monarchical Power there; which would be a buſineſſe of high advantage to Him. He muſt alſo beſtow on all Wiſe Men and ſuch as are the moſt Skilled in matters of Religion, greater gifts, then the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth; that ſo He may have them at his devotion, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver He ſhall have need of them. He muſt make choice of, and take into all His Higher Councels two or three of the <hi>Religious,</hi> either <hi>Jeſuits, Dominicans,</hi> or <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> that he may bind the Clergy the faſter to Himſelf, and that his Councellours may be the more Circumſpect, and may in their Determinations have more Authority. In all Wars that he takes in hand, every one of his Chief Commanders muſt have an Adjutant joyned to him out of the Clergy; for by this meanes the Souldiers will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to their Commands with the more Reverence; neither is any thing to be done, without their being firſt acquainted therewith. But eſpecially the Stipends of all Poor Maimed Souldiers are to be diſtributed to them by the hands of thoſe of the Clergy; for this is the Miſery of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they pay their mony, and know neither how, nor to whom. And by this meanes under the Banner of Religion, He ſhall both make the <hi>Pope</hi> more firm to him, and ſhall alſo eſtabliſh his own Empire; and ſo complying with <hi>Divine Fate,</hi> He ſhall raigne the more happily, and be the more Fortunate. Neither ought He ever to commend to the <hi>Pope</hi> for Eccleſiaſtical Dignities and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch perſons as are not fit for the ſame; that ſo He may have the greater credit with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that thoſe Perſons, whoſe wiſedom and parts He hath commended to him, may be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118554:18"/>the more approved, and eſteemed. He muſt alwayes likewiſe be making Propoſals, and laying down the wayes by which the Infidels are to be ſet upon: and he muſt be earneſt with the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he proclame that all ſuch Princes are worthy to be depoſed, that ſhall any way impede, or hinder ſuch Religious Expeditions. He ſhall do well alſo to build <hi>Hoſpitals, Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,</hi> and the like Charitable Places, which, as they are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and give encouragement to the Souldiery, ſo may they ſerve alſo as ſo many Seminaries, both for Souldiers and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for the contriving of Engines for war; in which Houſes, Maimed Souldiers and Engineers may be carefully lookt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and may alſo have Indulgencies propoſed unto them, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. He muſt alſo be ſure, that whatſoever Expeditions He ſhall undertake, they ſhall be approved of by the <hi>Pope;</hi> that ſo they may be commended by all Chriſtians, and alſo that the <hi>Craft</hi> of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> may be the leſſe ſuſpected; and that the Pope alſo himſelf may be the more ingaged to ſee the ſame brought to good effect. He muſt declare alſo to the World, that He conceives the Right of Empire to conſiſt, not in Armes alone; (contrary to the Opinion of the Roman <hi>Scipio,</hi> who being askt by a certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commander, What Right he had to <hi>Spain?</hi> anſwered him, only by ſhewing him the Armie he had brought againſt it;) but in the Auſpicious <hi>Fate</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie. According to what <hi>Jephta</hi> anſwered, when he was askt the ſame queſtion; <hi>Jud.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Wilt not thou poſſeſſe that which Chemoſh thy God giveth thee to poſſeſſe? So whomſoever the Lord our God ſhall drive out from before us, them will we poſſeſſe.</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore the <hi>Spaniard</hi> getteth under the Victorious Banner of Chriſt, it is his own Right. And this I ſpeak in reference to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Subduing of the <hi>New World,</hi> which is blamed by ſo many, For ſeeing that the <hi>Indians</hi> had Violated the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> invading them upon the Intereſt of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> (whoſe Handmaid the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is) their Country is his lawful poſſeſſion; in like manner as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeized upon the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> after that the iniquities of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were once grown full; So alſo the Turkes having poſſed themſelves of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under the Conduct and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> for our ſins, they poſſeſſe it now as their own Right, as if <hi>Chemoſh</hi> had given it them. But neither are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118554:19"/>all meanes of recovering that Empire again denied us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; when as we ſhall have repented of that ſin, which was the cauſe that we loſt it; namely, the Diſcord of the Chriſtian World. For then the Angel of that Empire, which now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, and takes care of It, not for that falſe <hi>Macon's</hi> ſake, whom It invokes; but by reaſon of the juſt Judgment of God, ſhall come over unto Us.</p>
               <p>And theſe Arguments are of very great moment for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, or (as I may better call it) the Juſtifying of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions; the juſtice of which, <hi>Lactantius</hi> eſpecially, <hi>lib. de Juſtitia Dei,</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>e. and ſome other of our later Writers underſtood not.</p>
               <p>But now, it ſeems to me very expedient, for the inducing of the <hi>Pope</hi> to ſtand wholly for the King of Spain, and that the <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> may advance His Monarchy, if that King <hi>Philip</hi> would promiſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> that He, (whereto the reſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes ſhould give their aſſent,) would obſerve inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that Conſtitution of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> wherein he affirms, That in all Cauſes, and from what Powers and Courts of Judicature ſoever, <hi>Appeales</hi> may be made to the Tribunals of the Biſhops; who are called by Him, <hi>Angeli Dei,</hi> Gods Angels; and <hi>Dei terreſtres,</hi> Gods on Earth.</p>
               <p>For when the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall once find this promptneſſe, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of Mind in him, He cannot chuſe but alwaies be a friend unto him. Neither can this be any diminution at all of the Dignity of the King: for the reſt of the Chriſtian Princes will never give their conſent hereto, without all doubt; and ſo all buſineſſes will be betwixt the <hi>Pope</hi> and Him onely to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But in caſe that They ſhould alſo give their aſſents to this, all Cauſes would preſently be put neceſſarily into the <hi>Popes</hi> hands; ſo that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having united his Monarchy to the <hi>Popes,</hi> He ſhould that way alſo have Dominion over the reſt.</p>
               <p>And that this may not prove prejudicial to him, He may erect ſome kind of Supreme Councel, and Court of Judicature, into which there ſhall be admitted Two Biſhops, and His own <hi>Confeſſor;</hi> and Himſelf alſo, as a Clergy Man, ſhall have a Power of Voting there, (for as much as the Kings Eldeſt Son is alwaies to be initiated into the Order of the Clergy:) and to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118554:19"/>this Councel there ſhould be liberty of <hi>Appeal,</hi> as from all other Tribunals, ſo from that even of the Biſhops alſo, in caſe they ſhall oppreſſe either their own, or the Kings Subjects. For by this means, the King ſhall in effect be the ſole Judge, not onely of all other Courts, but even of that of the Biſhops too, as being Himſelf one of the Holy Order of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
               <p>And by this means He ſhall evade that dangerous opinion of <hi>D. Rota,</hi> who ſayes, that <hi>The Kings Subjects, when they are hardly dealt withal by the Prelats, may appeal to the Supreme Councel of Spain.</hi> Which Aſſertion is certainly both an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and an Heretical one, and is of dangerous conſequence alſo to the King; for it tends to the rendring Him odious to his people, and diminiſheth rather, then encreaſeth His Authority; as we find it teſtified by daily Experience. Or elſe, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be deſired at the Popes hands that it ſhould be ſo; and it may alſo be declared, that the King is willing to yield, that in all Cauſes whatſoever there ſhould be Appeales to the <hi>Pope,</hi> if ſo be that it may be but every where allowed to appeal firſt to a Councel of Three Biſhops: or elſe, that Appeales in all Cauſes of the Laity ſhall come at length to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but paſſing firſt by degrees, through a Councel, conſiſting of two Biſhops, and a King; and ſo to be referred afterward to a General Councel; and laſt of all to come to the <hi>Pope:</hi> for, Appeals from General Councels are very ſeldome heard of; and beſides, the very Name of a Councel is hateful to the <hi>Pope.</hi> So that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the determination of all Cauſes will alwaies reſt with the King; who by this means ſhall be a Gainer, where he ſeems to be a Loſer.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E cannot govern the World, that cannot govern an Empire, neither can he rule an Empire, that cannot a Kingdom; nor he a Kingdom, that cannnot a Province: nor he a Province, that cannot a City; nor he a City, that cannot a Village; nor he a Village, that cannot a Family; nor he a Family, that cannot a ſingle houſe; nor he a ſingle houſe that cannot govern himſelf; neither can he govern himſelf, that cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his affections, and bring them within the compaſſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which very thing no man is able to do, except he ſubmit himſelf to the will of God. For whoſoever rebels againſt God, who is the <hi>Supreme Wiſdom,</hi> againſt him ſhall all things that are ſubordinate to him rebel alſo; and that juſtly, and by the Law of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> which is moſt juſt in all both Governments, and Actions of Men. Having therefore weighed in our mind, and conſidered all the <hi>Ideas</hi> and Formes of Humane Government, we ſay, that the King of Spains endeavours muſt be, that He may arrive to the Higheſt pitch of Wiſdom that may be. For every <hi>Virtue</hi> is an <hi>Affection</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> conſiſting in a certain <hi>Mean;</hi> beyound which if it ariſe, or fall beneath it, it comes to be a <hi>Vice.</hi> Now it is <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that conſtitutes this <hi>Mean:</hi> And therefore we are to ſay, that <hi>Actions</hi> alone do not render a man <hi>Vertuous;</hi> but to this purpoſe there is required alſo a <hi>Natural Inclination</hi> in the Perſon, which is derived both from the Complexion of his <hi>Parents,</hi> from the <hi>Aire,</hi> and from the Stars.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> is not an Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive one, but deſcends by ſucceſſion, I ſay, that the King ought to have but one wife, (for to have more is contrary to <hi>Reaſon</hi> it <hi>ſelf;)</hi> which is to be of a tall Stature; and ſhe muſt be both fruitful and Eloquent, and muſt excel all other women in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments both of Body and Mind. Neither muſt he look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Noblenſſe of her Family only; for ſo ſhe may chance to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118554:21"/>be barren, or may ſome other waies be not ſo pleaſing to Him; and he ſhould be overwhelmed with all thoſe miſchieifs that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> was, or the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> Whence <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> might ſeem to deſerve commendation, if he had married <hi>Blanch</hi> only becauſe he wanted an Heir to ſucceed him. The King is likewiſe to exerciſe the Act of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation with his Queen under a Fortunate Planet onely, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Digeſtion is finiſhed; and beſides, he muſt not do this, till after he hath abſtained ſome reaſonable time from the ſaid Act, to the end that his ſeed may be the more fruitful; and when ever he hath any thing to do with his Queen, he ought at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to be very hot in his love to her; for it is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the whole World, what the ſeed of the King be. And I could wiſh, that all men did obſerve theſe Rules! But the World is now come to that paſſe, that men take more care to have a generous Breed of Horſes, then to have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Children. Then muſt his Queen, when ſhe is with Child, uſe ſome Moderate Exerciſe, that ſo the Child may be the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When ſhe hath brought forth a Son, there muſt be ſome woman, that is a Gentlewoman provided to be his Nurſe; which Gentlewoman muſt alſo be a Wiſe woman, and of a high Spirit too. For, the Manners are ſuckt in, together with the <hi>Milk</hi> of the Nurſe. When the Child is grown up to ſome Maturity. He muſt converſe with Men, rather then with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and he muſt delight himſelf with the looking upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Figures, and alſo with Maps, and draughts of the Kingdoms He is born to; He may alſo look upon Horſes, and Armes: but he muſt not be ſuffered to run about to idle Childiſh ſports and plaies: as were the ſons of <hi>Cyrus, Cambyſes,</hi> and <hi>Darius:</hi> as if they had been born for themſelves only, and not for their People: and who therefore <hi>(as Plato ſaies)</hi> came to deſtruction. He muſt have Religious Tutors, both Biſhops, and Commanders, that are eminent for their knowledge in Martial affaires: He muſt alſo have Eloquent perſons, that may inſtruct him in the Art of Oratory, and informing him rather in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Rules, then the trifling Quiddities of Grammer. After he hath grown paſt a Child, he muſt then exerciſe both his Mind, and his Body alſo: for <hi>Valour,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> are Virtues that are proper to Princes. And we are to know, that what Prince ſoever ſhall uſe the Exerciſe of Body only, and not of his <hi>Wit,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118554:22"/>(as well his own, as his Subjects,) he ſhall be a ſlave to him that exerciſeth his <hi>Wit</hi> too.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that the King of <hi>France,</hi> and his Officers of State, yeilded themſelves up to <hi>Calvin;</hi> as the <hi>Germans</hi> did to <hi>Luther;</hi> both which ſo bewitched their eyes, that they took all for right and good, whatſoever theſe laid down before them. And thus the <hi>Tartarians</hi> alſo, after they had made themſelves Lords of the whole Eaſt, were at laſt made fools of by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> Prieſts. And if they are not enſlaved by Wicked Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, yet how ever they are ſlaves to thoſe that are Good, as well as Ingenious.</p>
               <p>And hence we ſee, that thoſe Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were both dull and wicked perſons, were given up into the hands of <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and others; who ſet them up, and depoſed them from their Thrones, for their Ignorance of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> likewiſe were in ſubjection to their Prieſts. And again on the other ſide, he, that exerciſeth his <hi>Wit</hi> only, is brought under the power of him that exerciſeth his Body, and Feats of Armes. Whence it is, that the <hi>Popes</hi> have ſo often been made the laughing ſtock of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards;</hi> and that Platonical King, <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> the ſecond K. of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> was ſubdued by <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> But that King that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth himſelf both theſe waies, he is the truly wiſe King. And hence it was that the <hi>Romans</hi> never exerciſed their <hi>Wit,</hi> without the exerciſe of the <hi>Body</hi> too; as <hi>Saluſt</hi> informs us. I adde moreover, that a King ought not to bend his ſtudies wholly to, and to ſpend all his time in one certain Science onely; as did King <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> who became one of the moſt famous Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the World; following the Example of King <hi>Atlas,</hi> who was overcome by <hi>Perſeus,</hi> a valiant Man of Armes, as the Fable tells us: nor yet would I have him to addict himſelf wholly to the Study of <hi>Divinity,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. did, who by this means utterly ruined his own Wit. But he ought to have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tutors for each ſeveral Science, and be a hearer of each of them at their ſeveral appointed times. But the Knowledge moſt ſit for the King, is, to know the Diviſion of the World into its parts, and of his own Dominions; the different manners and Cuſtomes of the ſeveral Nations of the Earth, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Sects; as alſo the ſtories of all the former Kings, and which of them was a Conquerour, and which was overcome, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118554:22"/>for what reaſons: And for this purpoſe he muſt make choice of the beſt Hiſtorians that have written. He muſt likewiſe know the ſeveral Lawes of Nations, and which are wholſome Lawes, and which not; and the Grounds they were made upon. But chiefly He is to be well skilled in the Lawes of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of the Kings his Predeceſſors; and to underſtand by what means <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth got here, or loſt there; and how <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſped in his wars: So likewiſe, with how many, and what kind of Nations and Kingdomes They made their Wars; and how the ſame Nations may be ſubdued. He muſt alſo give an ear to all ſorts of Counſels; but let him make choice of, and publiſh as His own, the Beſt, and Soundeſt onely. Let his rule be alſo, to inflict all puniſhments upon his Subjects in the name, and by the Miniſtry of his Officers; but to confer all benefits, and rewards upon them with his own hand, and in his own name. In a word, he muſt be adorned with all kinds of Vertues; and let it be his chiefeſt deſire to leave to His Succeſſors Himſelf an Example worthy of their Imitation; as it muſt be his care to imitate all the wiſeſt of his Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Affections which he ought with his utmoſt power to reſtrain, are <hi>Grief, Pleaſure, Love, Hatred, Hope, Fear,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Mercy</hi> alſo. For when a King ſhewes himſelf to be caſt down by any Ill Fortune that hath befallen him, He betrayes his own Weakneſſe, diſcourages his Subjects; and, laſtly, gives himſelf wholly to grieve for the ſame: for which King <hi>David</hi> was juſtly reproved by <hi>Joab,</hi> when he lamented ſo exceſſively the death of his Son <hi>Abſalon.</hi> As on the contrary ſide, when he is too much lifted up with Joy for any good ſucceſſe, it argues in him an abject and ſervile Diſpoſition and Temper: And eſpecially, if he addict himſelf to keep company with Buffoons and Jeſters, and give himſelf up to exceſſive Banquettings, and other the like pleaſures, he muſt needs be deſpiſed by his Subjects: as <hi>Nero</hi> was, who minded nothing but Stage-Playes, and his Harp; or <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> who giving themſelves over wholly to Women, and Feaſting, were therefore ſcorned by their Subjects, and depoſed, with the loſſe of their Lives.</p>
               <p>And indeed the <hi>Love of Women</hi> will very often endanger him, unleſſe he fortifie his mind againſt it: (as it happened to the moſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118554:23"/>Wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelf:) and eſpecially of his own Wife, who commonly hates her Husbands neareſt, and moſt intimate friends; conceiving, that the greateſt ſhare of His Affection is due to Her ſelf: in ſo much, that ſhe will hate and perſecute the Wiſeſt, and ableſt Commanders for War that are about him.

                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> Wife to the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> dealt with <hi>Narſes;</hi> who being thereby very much incenſed, he took occaſion to invite the <hi>Lombards</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> to the infinite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and loſſe both of the Emperour and Empreſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Covetouſneſſe</hi> alſo proves the ruine of Kings; as we ſee in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who pillaged the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Dodonaeus;</hi> and in <hi>Caligula,</hi> who having profuſely waſted all his own, moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gaped after other mens eſtates: whence they both came to be hated by their Subjects, and ſo died a miſerable death. Such a one alſo was <hi>Midas,</hi> who wiſhed, That whatſoever he touched might preſently turn to Gold; whereas he could neither eat his Gold, nor could it procure him an houres ſleep when he wanted it; that is to ſay, it was of no uſe at all to him; but it onely laid him open to the ſpoyl of him, that had but the Skill to make uſe of his Iron. <hi>Caligula</hi> in one year conſumed riotouſly ſeventeen Millions of Crowns, which his Predeceſſor <hi>Tiberius</hi> had ſcraped up together: and was afterward reduced to that want, that he was forced to betake himſelf to ſpoyl his Subjects, and to practiſe all manner of Cruelties upon them. King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> alſo, what in building of Sumptuous Palaces, and Temples, and about other moſt chargeable Pomps and Magnificences, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the better part of a Hundred and twenty Millions, which his Father <hi>David</hi> had left him: and notwithſtanding that he had no trouble upon him from any part, yet did he ſo exceſſively overburden his Subjects with Taxes, that being become Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the greateſt part of his People, he loſt a great part of his Kingdome, in his Son <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do allow in our King a deſire of <hi>Honour;</hi> but ſo, that he aſpire to it by the ſteps of <hi>Vertue:</hi> for otherwiſe He will gain onely the opinion of being <hi>Proud;</hi> which was the ruine of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boin,</hi> and <hi>Attila.</hi> And indeed <hi>Honour</hi> is the Witneſſe to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi> and therefore whoſoever is a <hi>Vertuous</hi> Perſon, he ſhall attain to <hi>True Honour,</hi> without any <hi>Flattery;</hi> which hath been the overthrow of many a Prince in the World.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118554:23"/>
               <p>And hence it will alſo follow, that a Prince ſhould not enter into ſo ſtrict a Tye of Friendſhip with any One, or Two of his Subjects, as to indulge them the liberty of tranſgreſſing the bounds of Juſtice, and the Lawes, without controul: For by ſo doing, the Principal Perſons of his Nobility, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in War, laying aſide all duty, will look upon him as an Abject, Unworthy perſon. And, which is more, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in theſe caſes enter into Conſpiracies againſt Him; and that very perſon, whom He advanced to ſo much honour as to make him his Favourite, may chance to uſurp the Kingdome: as we read it happened betwixt <hi>Gyges,</hi> and <hi>Candaules,</hi> King of <hi>Lydia.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Sejanus</hi> did much miſchief to the Emperour <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> who notwithſtanding was as ſubtle and crafty as any man: But yet <hi>Macro</hi> did more, who made an end of him. Neither can any thing be more deſtructive to a Prince, then to ſingle out One onely, to be his Friend and Favourite. And hath not <hi>Antonio Perez</hi> been of very ill Conſequence to the Preſent King? If the King hate any particular perſons, he muſt by no means diſcover it; unleſſe he find that they are hated by the People alſo: as are commonly all Hereticks, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Uſurers, and Publick Executioners of Juſtice upon Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: for by ſo doing. He ſhall the more indear himſelf to the People. He muſt alſo take notice, that <hi>Accuſations</hi> among his Subjects do not ſo much avail his Kingdome, as <hi>Calumnies</hi> hurt it, and therefore He ought alwaies to encline rather to the Accuſed Party. And to the end that he may attain to the higheſt degree of his Subjects Love, and Affection, He muſt ſet up ſome <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> that ſhall be above all other Courts whatſoever; that all ſuch perſons as are condemned to death, may have yet ſome left to whom they may appeal.</p>
               <p>And the King ought to pardon Offenders often, where it may be done ſafely enough; and where the Condemned perſon hath not been admitted to make his Appeal to the Kings Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or hath not offended either againſt the State, or Religion: and theſe Offenders by Him pardoned, may be ſent out either for Souldiers, or elſe to the Gallies: and this will do very much good. And of this <hi>Court of Grace,</hi> I would have the King himſelf to be Preſident; and it ſhould conſiſt onely of his Queen, and his Children, and one Biſhop only.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:118554:24"/>
               <p>The King muſt alſo with all Modeſty, and Humility, put his chiefeſt truſt in God, and repoſe but little confidence in his own ſtrength: eſpecially when He is not endued with any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prudence for the managing of the ſame: and all the wrightieſt of his Actions muſt be referred to God, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them, that ſo they may be lookt upon by all with the greater reverence, and eſteem. Let him never hope with a few to vanquiſh a greater number, nor with Undiſciplined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Souldiers: nor to conquer a forraine enemy in his own Country: of which things I have elſewhere ſpoken. He muſt alwayes remove all <hi>Fear</hi> far from him; and he muſt diſcover his onely <hi>Fear</hi> to be, leſt any Sad Diſaſter ſhould befall either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or his Subjects. And in all His Expeditions He muſt ſhew himſelf to the Height of Valour, and even of bold Daring too: provided that he do it with Reaſon, and that ſo He may the more inflame the courage of his Souldiers. Neither ought he ever to ſeem to be Jealous of the Worth of any one; leſt he ſhould ſo betray His own Timorouſneſſe, and Pooreneſſe of Spirit. And therefore, to the end that his Subjects may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, His ſafeſt courſe will be, to keep them alwayes up in Armes, rather then to let them lie unarmed quietly at home: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Armes, they will the eaſier be kept within the bounds of Obedience. Becauſe that, if they be by fair, and Prudential meanes kept in awe, they will be ready to make uſe of their Armes at all times for their Kings advantage; but if, though Unarmed, they be otherwiſe then fairely dealt with by their Prince, they will be apt to revolt from him, or (which is worſe) will find Armes, which they will turn againſt Him. An example of this kind we have in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> who was Jealous of <hi>David,</hi> ſeeing his Valour and Worth. The King ought alſo, as often as he begins to be Jealous, and fearful of the Greatneſſe of any of his Subjects, under the ſhew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him, to ſend him abroad out of the Country he is powerful in, to ſome other; as <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> dealt with the Great Duke <hi>Conſalvus;</hi> removing him from <hi>Naples,</hi> where he might poſſibly have raiſed Commotions in the State, to Spain, where he was not able to do any ſuch thing. Neither yet are ſuch Men too much to be ſlighted; for by this meanes the Prince might ncurre the hatred of his Subjects; and it would be a diſcouragement to them from the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118554:24"/>endeavouring at any High and Noble Actions. Therefore ſuch perſons, as He is Jealous of, are to be employed in ſuch places, where there is the leaſt danger to be feared from them: as, we read, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was called home by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> where he was beloved by all men; and ſent him againſt <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings <hi>Anger</hi> muſt neither be Violent, nor Headlong; as was <hi>Alexander's</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> againſt his Nobles; for ſo he may chance to be made away by poyſon, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was: and his Subjects may fall off from him, and ſo his Power will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; as it happened to <hi>Theoderick</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna;</hi> and which was alſo the cauſe of the Emperour <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian's</hi> death. In times of Peace He muſt be merciful to ſuch as offend either out of Ignorance, or Weakneſſe of Body or Mind; and that, in favour of the Multitude, and to ſweeten Them: but this he muſt take heed of, in time of War; and he muſt not pardon any Egregious Offenders, or that are the Heads, and Ringleaders of any Faction: eſpecially where the Worth of the Perſons is not ſo great, as that, being pardoned, they may be of greater uſe to him, then that wherein they offended was preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial. Thus <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> pardoned <hi>Moſes</hi> rebelling againſt him, as being the Greateſt Commander he had under him: who thereby became afterwards of very great Uſe, and Advantage to him: In like manner as <hi>David</hi> alſo pardoned <hi>Joab.</hi> But yet we muſt remember, that this Eaſineſſe, and Mercifulneſſe is then only ſeaſonable, where the Crime concerns not the State it ſelf, but onely Particular perſons. And therefore the Prince ought not at any time to deny the Legal Proceeding of Juſtice to any one; For, for this very cauſe, <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> And therefore, as we have formerly ſaid, he ought to be careful, and circumſpect in the curbing, and bridling of his own Paſſions and Affections.</p>
               <p>But now, Piety, and Religion is of it ſelf ſufficient to make any Prince exerciſe his power of Dominion Juſtly, and happily: as we ſee by the Examples of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and the like. And here we are alwaies to remember, that it is moſt certain, that, <hi>The People do naturally follow the Inclinations of their Prince.</hi> And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>If the King but mend, all the Kingdome mends,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the acceſſion of any other Law. And therefore the Virtue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118554:25"/>of the Prince ought to ſurpaſſe, in a manner, all Humane ſenſe.</p>
               <p>As concerning Making of War, it is certain and evident to all, that Warlike Princes have ſtill had the better of thoſe that are not ſo inclined: and although Wiſe Kings have alwaies made a ſhift to preſerve their own, yet they have not alwaies enlarged their Dominions: but the idle, and ſloathful have ever been of the loſing hand. I ſay therefore, that a King, if he would be accounted a warlike Prince, ought to go in perſon to the Wars; eſpecially, where he is certain of Victory. Thus <hi>Joab,</hi> having for ſome time beſieged that City of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and being now ready to take it, he gave notice to the King, that He ſhould come, and be at the delivery of it up, that ſo the Glory of the Action might be His. For by this means the People will be ready to admire their King, as if he were ſomething more then a King. But He muſt be ſure to decline all Evident Dangers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Duels; <hi>Leſt</hi> (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaid to <hi>David) He quench the Light of Iſrael.</hi> For this was accounted a great fault in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, that he would needs leap down firſt himſelf from off the Walls into a certain Town; where He by that meanes received many Wounds: For by that raſh Act of his, he in His Single perſon brought into Hazard the Monarchy of the whole World. He muſt alſo reward his Old Souldiers with his Own hand, and muſt prefer them to the Government of Caſtles, and Forts: and the rawer ſort of Souldiers he muſt cauſe to exerciſe themſelves in light skirmiſhes among themſelves, and in exerciſes of the Field.</p>
               <p>Every King that ſwaieth a Scepter is either a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> or a <hi>Hireling,</hi> or laſtly a <hi>Shepheard;</hi> as <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Holy Goſpel it ſelf alſo calls him. A <hi>Tyrant</hi> is the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> that keepes the Flock for his own Advantage; and alwayes maketh away with all the Wealthieſt, Wiſeſt &amp; Valianteſt of his Subjects; that ſo he may fill his own bags, and may without any danger or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule, Lord it as he liſt, and range about through the whole flock, ſpoyling whom he pleaſe. And if the King of Spain ſhould go about to ſhew himſelf ſuch a one to his Subjects, he will loſe all; as did thoſe <hi>Dionyſij</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe, Acciolinus</hi> of <hi>Padoua, Caligula, Nero, Vitellius,</hi> and the like. The <hi>Hireling</hi> is, he that kills not indeed his Subjects; but rather drawes to himſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118554:25"/>all Profits, Honours, and advantages acquired by the ſervice of his Souldiers and Vaſſals; but he doth not at all defend them from the Ravenous <hi>Wolves;</hi> I mean, <hi>Falſe Teachers;</hi> nor other fierce Invaders, and Oppreſſors. As we may call the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Hireling</hi> Rulers of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> ſeeing that they did not defend it againſt the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo were ſuch, in Relation of the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> from whoſe necks they did not keep off <hi>Hannibals</hi> yoak. And in like manner we may tearm <hi>Don Philip Maria</hi> the <hi>Hireling Vicount</hi> of the <hi>Genowayes;</hi> for he mad onely a benefit of them, but ſhewed not himſelf as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour over them; Which cannot now be ſaid of the King of Spain. And theſe <hi>Hirelings,</hi> or <hi>Mercenary</hi> Princes, are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly loſers by it, as the former were. As, wee ſee, the King of <hi>France</hi> loſt, by ſuffering <hi>Calvin</hi> to mount up into the Chaire; as the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> likewiſe did, by ſuffering that Wolf <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> For he that makes a prey of Mens Mind, hath command over their Bodies alſo: and will at length have the diſpoſing of their Fortunes and eſtates too. And therefore it is a meer Folly, and Ignorance in thoſe Princes, whoſoever they be, that ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit New Religions into their Dominions, whereby the Minds of their Subjects are lead away. And hence it was that Saul foreſaw his own Ruin, ſo ſoon as ever he perceaved the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People inclined towards <hi>David.</hi> And the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of <hi>Germany, Poland,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> have been infinite, ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> making a Prey and carring away the Minds and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Inhabitants of theſe Countries. But that King is a Shepheard, that feeds Himſelf with the Honour, and Love of his People; and them, with his own Example, Learning, and Abundance of good Things; and withall defends them by his Armes, and Wholeſome Lawes. And therefore a good King ought to be endued with ſo much a greater proportion of Learning and Knowledge above his People (who do infinitely herein excel Brute Beaſts,) as the Shepheard is above his Mute Flock. So that a Prince (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid) is ſomewhat above Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Condition, and ought to be eſteemed as a kind of God, or a Chriſt; or at leaſt is to be reputed as qualified with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meaſure of Divinity, and to have ſome eminent knowledge conferred upon him from above, as had that Divine Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver <hi>Moſes;</hi> and as at this day have the Pope, and the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. Or if this be not granted to Him, he ought however, hrough Humane Virtue at leaſt, to ſubmit, and yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118554:26"/>to the Divine Law-giver; as did <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. And there have been ſome, who wiſely conſidering theſe things have endeavoured to perſwade the World, that they were Inſpired from Heaven, as did <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and <hi>Minos;</hi> whoſe Lawes were thereby held in great Reverence by the People. And certainly whereſoever the King ſhall approve himſelf to be ſuch, the People in general will be made good; where as on the contrary, if the Prince be Bad, the People will be ſo too. And therefore following the Example of the Pope, and his Biſhops, he ought to appear as like them as he can, doing nothing at all without their approbation, but making a Union betwixt his Kingdom and their Church, ſo to make up one Body of a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick betwixt them; as I have ſaid before; and by obſerving the Eccleſiaſtical Order, and by conſtituting good Lawes, he muſt render himſelf Worthy of Reverence from the People: which by appearing but ſeldom abroad among them in Publique, he ſhall be ſure to have from them.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Acts which Humane Nature cannot abſtain from, as eating, and the like, theſe he ought to do privately. Or if at any time he do any of them in Publick, He muſt alwaies, after the example of <hi>Philop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emen,</hi> the General of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> have ſome by him to diſcourſe touching Peace and War. Our King muſt not endeavour ſo much to be Accounted a Vertuous Perſon, as to be ſo Really: for, where any one is diſcovered to have but once played the Diſſembler, no body will ever believe him again afterwards.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that, for want of Iſſue to ſucceed him, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may eaſily fall to the ground; His chiefeſt care muſt be, that he get children as ſoon, and early as he can. And ſo ſoon as ever his Eldeſt Son ſhall be grown up to any maturity, and himſelf perchance is yet a young man; he may then do well to ſend him to <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo he may be inſtructed both in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the World, and in thoſe of Religion alſo; and withal, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Spain may be the more firmly incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, by having both the Cardinals, and Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alwayes true to their Faction: and alſo, that His Son, and the Barons may not dare to joyn together, and take up Armes againſt Him; (which our King <hi>Philip</hi> ſuſpected of his Son <hi>Charles;</hi>) and ſo, by <hi>Obeying,</hi> he ſhall learn how to <hi>Rule.</hi> The King of Spain ought alſo alwayes to deſign ſome of the Houſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118554:26"/>of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to be his ſucceſſor, in caſe that he ſhould die without a ſucceſſor of his own.</p>
               <p>Let him alwayes ſpeak the Language of his Native Country, and give Audience to ſuch only as ſpeak the ſame. He ought alwayes to keep his Court in Spain, the Head of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; neither let him ever go out of it, unleſſe it be to the Wars, and leaving his Son behind him: Or, to ſuppreſſe ſome muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Province, or ſome Baron that he ſuſpects, He may go and take up his quarters among them; that ſo, being thereby redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to want, and ſcarcity, they may be forced to ſerve the King inſtead of Souldiers, and He by this means may be freed from all fears and jealouſies. The reſt of His Male Children, that are not brought up in the hope, and expectation of Reigning; he may make Cardinals; neither ought he at any time to commit the rains of Government to their hands, leaſt happily they ſhould be poſſeſſed with a deſire of Ruling. And hence it is, that among the <hi>Turks</hi> it is the Cuſtome, alwayes to make away with all the yonger Sons. And the King of <hi>China</hi> ſhuts up thoſe that are next in blood to Him, in large, ſpacious places, which abound with all variety both of neceſſaries, and Delights: as the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> confines all his to a certain very high, and moſt pleaſant Mountain, called <hi>Amara;</hi> where they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, tell they ſhall be called to ſucceed in the Kingdom. But yet for all this, neither doth the King of <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining their neareſt of kin, nor the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> by killing his, nor yet the <hi>Moor,</hi> by putting out the Eyes of his, acquit themſelves from the danger and fear of Seditions, and Rebellions. For notwithſtanding that the Parents of theſe confined Perſons may haply bear it with a patient and quiet mind enough; yet it may poſſibly be, that either the Common People, or the Nobles of the Kingdome, being moved either with Indignation, and Fury, or elſe Fear of Puniſhment, or deſire of Revenge, may corrupt, and provoke thoſe Perſons ſo ſhut up; or by killing their Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, may carry them away out of their priſons by force, and may place them in the Throne: as thoſe they call, <hi>The Common Rebels of</hi> Spain, attempted to carry away by force the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who was at that time a Priſoner in the <hi>Sciattive Tower.</hi> And in <hi>China</hi> many moſt cruel Tyrants of both ſexes, both Kings, and Queens, have been murdered. And of late years, in <hi>Ethiopia, Abdimalo</hi> was called to the Crown, not from out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118554:27"/>of the Mountain of <hi>Amara,</hi> but from out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whether he had fled to preſerve himſelf. Neither is there any Country, where there have been more Civil Wars, and Rebellions raiſed, then among the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Mauritania.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Ormus,</hi> before that that Country was ſubdued by the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> were wont to kill their Parents: which cuſtome was practiſed alſo by ſome Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> by the Kings of <hi>Tunis</hi> alſo, and of <hi>Marocco,</hi> and <hi>Fez;</hi> as likewiſe among the <hi>Turks:</hi> as appears by the Wars betwxt <hi>Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Zerim,</hi> and of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi> and his father, <hi>Bajazet</hi> the ſecond. Therefore this Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Turks</hi> renders them not much more ſecure thereby. For in other Kingdomes it is onely Ambition, and a deſire of Honour, and Rule that excites men to raiſe ſedition, and to take up Armes againſt the Prince: Which Ambitious Deſires may either be ſatisfied ſome other way, or be diverted to ſome other deſign, or poſſibly may be overawed, and cruſht: But thoſe of the Blood Royal among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> beſides Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have a Neceſſity alſo of ſeeking the preſervation of their own Lives, to force them on to ſuch Attempts. For, ſeeing they are all certainly enough aſſured, that they ſhall be put to death by the ſucceeding Emperour, they have need all of them to provide for themſelves; and ſo are neceſſitated, in a manner, to take up Armes, and to implore the aid and aſſiſtance either of ſubjects at home, of Forrain Princes abroad. Hence it was that <hi>Selim</hi> was wont to ſay, that He was to be excuſed for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made away with ſo many of his Brothers, Nephews, and Kindred; ſeeing that otherwiſe the meaneſt perſon of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> line, that ſhould have but ſcaped acting a part in that Tragedy, might have come to the ſame Dignity He enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But, paſſing by theſe Impious, and yet Ineffectual Examples of Cruelty, let us now come to the <hi>Daughters</hi> of the King of Spain. And theſe Probably may do well to be matched with the Kings, or Princes of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> and alſo with the Kings of <hi>Denmark, Muſcovia, England,</hi> and the like: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition, that theſe Princes promiſe faithfully to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Catholick Religion;</hi> which if they would do, there would thence a double Benefit accrue.</p>
               <p>The King muſt take into his Court, all the moſt able, and moſt knowing in all ſorts of Sciences: and He muſt endeavour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118554:27"/>to render both Himſelf, and his Children, as excellent in them as is poſſible; that ſo the Eyes of all men may be turned upon Him, and His, and may joyn themſelves unto them, ſeeing them live ſo happily and ſecurely. In like manner, as all the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even to the <hi>Maccabees</hi> themſelves, who had God for their Guide, became yet admirers of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a League with them, fled to Them for Protection. Now He that protects, or aſſiſts, may naturally be ſaid to be Lord of him whom he protects; as the <hi>Man</hi> became Lord of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> whiles He aſſiſted him againſt the <hi>Stag.</hi>

               <p>The like courſe alſo was taken by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who took upon himſelf the Title of <hi>Gods Commiſſary:</hi> for Theſe introduced into the World the Practiſe of <hi>Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;</hi> a Science till then never heard of before; and furniſhed it out with great Variety of New, and Admirable Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> made the world believe, that their Prince, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, was the Son of <hi>Jupiter Ammon;</hi> and withal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118554:28"/>aboliſhing the <hi>Ancient Diſciplines,</hi> they brought in upon the Stage the <hi>Ariſtotelian;</hi> which confuted all that were before it: inſomuch that his Father, King <hi>Philip,</hi> rejoyced very much thereat, foreſeeing that this <hi>Novelty</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> would lay a Foundation for his ſon to erect a New Empire upon; and ſo thenceforward neglected the worſhip of <hi>Jupiter, Mercury, Oſiris,</hi> and the reſt of the moſt Ancient among the Gods. Thus <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> alſo, when he now aſpired to a Monarchy, introduced a <hi>New Religion;</hi> fitting it to his own Palat, and the Guſt of the People. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> likewiſe, being now got to be choſen the <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology</hi> being at that time not very well known to the <hi>Romans;</hi> He, by changing the <hi>Old Account,</hi> and rectifying the <hi>Year,</hi> laid the Foundation of His Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>And the ſame muſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo do; eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing He hath the beſt Opportunity that can be, of doing the ſame. For ſeeing that it is not Lawful at all times to introduce a <hi>New Religion,</hi> He ought therefore to adorn, and ſet forth the Old ſo much the more, and to enlarge it with variety of <hi>New Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> as alſo to bring Forth into the World <hi>New Sciences,</hi> and ſuch as ſhall be ſuitable to His Dignity.</p>
               <p>But above all, let him make a Law, to be obſerved by all Chriſtians; Firſt, That whenſoever any People or Country ſhall forſake the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, all Princes ſhall be bound, upon pain of forfeiting their Eſtates, to root out, and extirpate the ſame; like as God commanded <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Clergy, and ſuch as are skilled in Church Matters, ſhall make it Their care to look to the regulating of the Moneths of the Year, and the Daies of the Week; calling the ſeveral Moneths by the Names of the Twelve Apoſtles; and the ſeven Daies of the Week by the Names of the Seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the truth of it is, that the Inhabitants of the <hi>New World,</hi> when they find, in converſing with the Chriſtians, that the Heatheniſh Names of Moneths and Daies are ſtill in uſe among them, they are wrapt into a great admiration. And the like courſe is to be obſerved in other the like things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that ſeeing that <hi>New Sciences</hi> do make a New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy the more Admired, I would have the Schooles of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> opened again, whoſe Opinions
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118554:28"/>come nearer to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> then the <hi>Ariſtotelian.</hi> And, that we may deſcend to particulars, the <hi>Teleſian</hi> Philoſophy is the moſt excellent of all; ſeeing it comes the neareſt to the Holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> and makes it appear to the World, that the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers knew nothing; and that <hi>Ariſtotlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> who would have the <hi>Soul</hi> to be <hi>Mortal,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> to be <hi>Immortal,</hi> and denyes <hi>Providence</hi> alſo, (on which <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is grounded) talks very abſurdly, notwithſtanding all his ſo ſpecious Reaſons; ſeeing that the ſame are refuted by ſtronger Reaſons, fetcht in like manner from <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is neceſſary that he ſet the Wits of the Learned to work with <hi>Scholaſtick Queſtions;</hi> leſt by being converſant in the Sciences of Natural Things, it ſet an edge upon their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and by this meanes they ſhould aſpire to higher Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That He ſhould baniſh all <hi>Theological Queſtions</hi> out of the <hi>Tranſalpine</hi> Schools; ſeeing that all the Divines of thoſe parts turn Hereticks, by not continuing firm to the Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutious of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but are ſtill raiſing up freſh Controverſies: and the Wits of theſe men are to be exerciſed onely in the Diſputes of <hi>Natural Philoſophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, He muſt endeavour to get himſelf Renown, as <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> did, by reducing all the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes into One Body: and as <hi>Charles</hi> the Great did, by opening the School of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which was at that time the only School of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for all the reſt had been long before trodden down to the ground by the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> as I have ſhewed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He ſhall do well to ſhut up all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Schools; becauſe that theſe Two Languages have been deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Monarchy; and are, beſides, the Main Pillars by which thoſe Hereſies that chiefly raign at this day are built upon. And therefore, on the contrary, let him endeavour to bring in the Knowledge of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue; by meanes whereof the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> may be the better convinced; and the troubleſome <hi>Tranſalpine</hi> Wits may imploy themſelves rather in confuting the <hi>Turks,</hi> then in vexing the Catholicks with their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Let him alſo erect <hi>Mathematical</hi> Schools: becauſe this would be of great uſe and advantage in reſpect of the <hi>New
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118554:29"/>World,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Old:</hi> becauſe by this means the Peoples Minds will be diverted from creating Us any trouble, and will be incited to bend their ſtudies that way, which may be uſeful to the King. Then let him get about him the Ableſt <hi>Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers</hi> that he can, and aſſign them Liberall Allowances; Whoſe buſineſſe it ſhall be, to deſcribe thoſe ſeveral parts of the World whereſoever the Spaniards have ſet footing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Compaſſe of the whole Earth; becauſe that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> knew nothing of moſt of thoſe Countries at all; And let Him, by the Induſtry of theſe his Mathematicians, correct all the Errours of the Ancient <hi>Geographers:</hi> and he may alſo put forth a Book, under the Title of the King of Spains Name, wherein he ſhall ſet forth the praiſes due to <hi>Chriſtophorus Columbus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanus, Amoricus Veſputius, Ferdinandus Corteſius, Pizarrus,</hi> and others of his Valiant Sea-Commanders; whoſe Poſterity He ought to confer Dignities upon, for the Incouraging of others to fall upon the like undertakings. Let him alſo ſend able Aſtrologers abroad into the New World, and eſpecially ſome of thoſe beyond the <hi>Alpes;</hi> to the end that he may by this means alſo take them off from their Hereſies, and filth; and let him, by propoſing rewards to ſuch, invite the ableſt Wits out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſend them into the <hi>New World;</hi> that there they may give an account of, and deſcribe all the new Stars that are in that Hemisphere, from the <hi>Antarctick Pole</hi> to the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn:</hi> and may deſcribe the Holy Croſſe, whoſe figure is at that Pole; and about the Pole it ſelf they may place the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of <hi>Charles</hi> V. and of other Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> following herein the Example of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who placed in the Heavens the Images of their Princes and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes. For by this meanes both Aſtrology, and Local Memory will be both learnt together. And when any ſuch Illuſtrious Perſons are ſo advanced to Honour, and rendred ſo Venerable: and ſuch Aſtrologers are encouraged with large rewards, it is of no ſmall advantage to the enlargment of a Kingdom: For, all the Worlds Affections will be inclined toward ſuch a Prince, and will deſire to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>We are to know alſo, that the <hi>Novelty</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> is a great promoter of Monarchy; provided it be not againſt Religion, as was that of <hi>Luther:</hi> but that it rather agree well with it: as doth that of <hi>Teleſius,</hi> and that which I my ſelf have collected,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118554:29"/>by my reading of the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church: or at leaſt when it doth not contradict the ſame, but rather enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, and renders it admired by all men, and takes up the Minds of the People, and keeps them in, from running after, and employing themſelves in that which is prejudiciall to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> though his Opinions were impious, yet was he in nothing at all any hinderance to <hi>Alexander;</hi> and therefore much leſſe can there be any hurt, in ſuch a Doctrine as we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>The King muſt alſo take care to have the General Hiſtories and Annals of the Whole World, compiled in a compendious and ſuccinct way, like that of the Books of the <hi>Kings of the Hebrewes:</hi> and which may alſo ſhew from the firſt building of <hi>Rome</hi> the whole progreſſe of this Monarchy down to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, and may ſet down the time when the Chriſtian Faith was firſt embraced by it: and may make it known to all, ſo many Kings thereof as were Pious and, and Religious men, were all of high eſteem in the World, and reigned happily; but thoſe that were Wicked, and Ill men, were alſo Unfortunate.</p>
               <p>Let Him likewiſe cauſe a Brief Collection to be made of the Lawes of all the ſeveral Kingdomes and Principalities of the World, digeſted in their ſeveral Orders; as alſo their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cuſtomes; and let him make uſe of the beſt of theſe, and reject the bad. But he muſt be very careful, that He publiſh not in any place ſuch Lawes, as the Nature of that place cannot bear.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King of Spain, as well for Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as Politick reaſons, can enact no New Lawes. For the Chriſtian Law, together with the <hi>Roman</hi> Military Power and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is that which He ſucceeds in, and with which He is to comply. He muſt take heed therefore, that He make not many <hi>Pragmatical Sanctions.</hi> And it would be an excellent thing, if the Lawes, as far as it were poſſible, were all written in the Spaniſh Tongue; that ſo the whole World might be acquainted, and might have ſome commerce with the Spaniſh Monarchy, both in the Language, and the Lawes.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that this Monarchy had Its Riſe under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and Religion; the <hi>Latine</hi> is a Language that it needs not be aſhamed of.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch Lawes therefore be made, as the People may keep rather Willingly, then by compulſion, and through fear of puniſhment; as finding them to be advantagious to themſelves. For when ſuch Lawes are enacted, as make for the Profit of the Prince, or ſome few Particular perſons only, the People muſt needs be out of love with them; and then do they preſently find out waies to elude the ſame: whereupon there ſtrait fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes Confiſcation of the Subjects Goods, with Mulcts, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Baniſhment. Then muſt we have New Laws made, to puniſh the Tranſgreſſors of the Former; and then again other New Lawes muſt be made, for the puniſhing of ſuch as have offended againſt theſe latter: and thus is the Number of Lawes increaſed, the Princes Authority ſlighted, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at length, out of hate to their Prince, either riſe up againſt Him, or elſe forſake the Kingdom; to the very great damage (no queſtion) of the Prince: for by this means both the number
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118554:30"/>of the Souldiery is diminiſhed, and beſides, the Kings Subſidies grow leſſe. Every Tyrant therefore, that maketh Lawes that are for his Own Advantage only, and not for his Subjects, is a Fool: for by this meanes He loſeth himſelf; whereas on the other ſide, a wiſe King, while he ſeems to do things Prejudicial to himſelf, doth himſelf notwithſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the greateſt Right that can be. And we find by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that Princes that are Popular, are more extolled, then thoſe are that admit into their friendſhip and favour ſome few Noblemen, or Courtiers only: as we may obſerve in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Examples of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moreover neceſſary, that a Law be conformable to the Cuſtome of the place for which it is made: for all Northern People love Eaſie Lawes; and would rather obey out of their own Good Nature, then by Compulſion. And the not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this, was the reaſon of the Dukes <hi>D'Alva's</hi> loſing the Low-Countries. The Southern People, as thoſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluzia,</hi> require ſtrict Lawes; the <hi>Italians, Portuguez,</hi> and <hi>Calabrians,</hi> deſire a Mediocrity, and Moderation in their Lawes.</p>
               <p>The King muſt alſo conſider, as touching the <hi>New World,</hi> under what Climate each particular People there lyeth. For, thoſe that lye under the Equinoctial, would have Moderate Lawes; but thoſe that are under the Tropicks, muſt have more ſevere and rigid Lawes; as alſo thoſe that are under the Pole: but thoſe that are nearer to the Frigid Zone, deſire Milder Lawes: but thoſe that are more remote, and lye nearer to the Tropicks, as do the Inhabitants of <hi>Siam,</hi> require Auſtere Lawes, and ſuch as carry a Religious Reverence with them. But thoſe that are ſituate in a Middle Poſition, as the <hi>Italians</hi> are, are of like Nature to thoſe that lye under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial.</p>
               <p>When another Country loſeth any of its Inhabitants by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the difference of Religion, New Lawes are preſently to be made by ſome Biſhop, and ſome Eminent Commander of War, and a Colony of fit perſons is to be ſent thither: as, for example, <hi>Netherlanders</hi> may be ſent into <hi>Africk; Italians</hi> into the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> and Spaniards into the <hi>New World.</hi> And the fitteſt time to do this, is, when the War is on foot there: but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118554:31"/>when they begin once to yield, the Lawes may then be altered by little and little: as it is fit it ſhould be done in the Low-Countries, when the People there ſhall ſubmit, and yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Spaniards. For then there ſhould be more uſe made of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> in governing of them, then of the <hi>Sword:</hi> and the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is alſo to be kept up there under ſome Other Name, and Pretenſe.</p>
               <p>But if any City, or Country, that is addicted to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, be taken in; it will be ſufficient then to ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Spaniards onely to guard it; and ſome Wiſe Perſons, who by degrees may change the Lawes of the Place: but the King muſt put ſome of his own Subjects, and of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, into the higheſt, and chiefeſt places of truſt; but with the meaner and lower Offices he may intruſt the Inhabitants of the place: as Duke <hi>Francis</hi> did at <hi>Sena;</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Padoua.</hi> But when the Name of a Spaniard begins once to be hateful among them, let Him then ſend thither ſuch <hi>Italians</hi> as He may ſafely truſt, and employ them as his Miniſters there. Now what courſe is to be taken in the ſeveral Kingdomes belonging to the Spaniard, I ſhall ſhew hereafter. Onely this I ſhall ſay here, that the Firſt, and Principal <hi>Keeper of the Lawes</hi> ought to be <hi>Honour;</hi> the Second <hi>Love;</hi> and the Third, <hi>Fear:</hi> But where this Order is inverted, and runs the contrary way, nothing will there proſper.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Supreme Councel, or Court,</hi> ought to conſiſt of the King, and ſome few of the Wiſeſt of his Nobles, with ſome of the Clergy joyned to them. Yet the <hi>Court of Grace</hi> (of which I ſpake before) muſt be above the Supreme <hi>Court of Justice.</hi> The Councels of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are already managed rightly enough; yet their Decrees would be obſerved with greater Reverence,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118554:31"/>and Religion, if that courſe were taken which I before propoſed; namely, of adding to them a greater number of the Prelates: for by this means the Clergy will be the eaſier won; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the Decrees of the ſaid Councels will be of the greater eſteem, and reverence.</p>
               <p>We are to take notice alſo that perſons of any Nation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever are not fit to be preſently taken in for <hi>Counſellours;</hi> but ſuch only, as know the Cuſtomes of the Country, or are Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, as was <hi>Plato:</hi> or elſe have an excellent dexterity of wit, as had <hi>Cincinnatus.</hi> For as much therefore as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard is a perſon of good ability in all matters of a ſubtile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and where there is uſe of Good Language; as the <hi>Germans</hi> abilities lie chiefly in matters that are to be done by the Hand, and require Labour; and the <hi>Italians</hi> in matters of State Government, and Policy; it muſt therefore be the Kings Care, that he make a right Choice of theſe ſeveral perſons, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different Abilities make uſe of them in His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. My Opinion is therefore, that in Maritime Affairs, and whatſoever concerns Navigation, He ought chiefly to employ the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> and the <hi>Genoueſe:</hi> But in things which concern Mechanical Arts, Artificial Fire-works, and Engines of all ſorts, the <hi>Tranſalpine</hi> is the only man: but where the Government of State is concerned, let the <hi>Italian</hi> be there made uſe of: but as for Fortifications, keeping of Garriſons, making Diſcoveries, or giving Intelligence, and going on Embaſſies, or whatſoever concerns Religion, with any of theſe let the Spaniard be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that we would have the King of Spain to be Lord of the whole World, it muſt be his care, as much as he can, to draw on all Nations to comply with the Spaniſh Manners and Cuſtomes; that is, let Him make them all Spaniſh. Let Him alſo make them Partakers as well of Government, as of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; as the <hi>Romans</hi> of old did; and as the <hi>Turks</hi> Cuſtome is to do at this day. For otherwiſe, the Spaniard will be the leſſe couragious in War, as not having any to rival him in Military Glory and Renown; neither will the <hi>Counſellours</hi> ſtrive among themſelves, who ſhall excell the other in Smartneſſe, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Wit, when they find that all Forreign Nations are cut off from all hopes of being called to <hi>Counſel.</hi> I ſay therefore that Spaniards are for the moſt part, though not alwayes, to be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118554:32"/>admitted into the Counſel of Spain; and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Religious Orders:</hi> as being the only perſons that have little or no Intereſt of their own in Secular Affairs. Into the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> there muſt be taken in ſuch Spaniards, as have lived ſome time in <hi>Italy,</hi> with ſome <hi>Italians,</hi> and two out of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> For by this means all the ſeveral Nations will reſt ſatisfied, and the Kings <hi>Counſels</hi> will be the better tempered: becauſe the Spaniard will alwayes be of a Contrary Judgment to the <hi>Italian,</hi> as thinking himſelf the better man, and the greater reſpect and dignity due to him, becauſe the Head of the Empire is with Them: and the <hi>Italian,</hi> according to the Freedom of ſpirit of that Nation, will boldly give ſuch Counſel as he conceives to be ſound and Good, and endeavour to curbe and abate the Fierceneſſe of the Spaniard: and then muſt the <hi>Netherlander</hi> come in, and reconcile them to each other. The Councel of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> (ſeeing it is already granted, that the <hi>Councels</hi> of all Nations muſt be held in Spain) muſt be made up of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, Italians, and Natives, for the ſame two cauſes before given in. The <hi>Councels</hi> of both the <hi>Indias</hi> muſt conſiſt of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and ſuch of other Nations, as have continued in the ſame for ſome time, whether <hi>Engliſh, Genueſe,</hi> or others; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided alwayes, that into ſuch Councels as concern the State, there be taken in ſome that are of <hi>Religious</hi> Orders; and alſo ſome of the Wiſeſt among the Nobility, and any others that are well skilled in the Cuſtomes, Religion, Rites, Situation, and the Policy, both Domeſtick, and Military of the ſeveral Nations, what Country ſoever they themſelves be of.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here lay down one moſt Admirable and Profitable Rule more, for the King to obſerve, and that is, that every Seventh, and Ninth year (which are the Fatal Numbers) He ſhould call together all the Nobility of each of his ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, every one of which ſhall come to the Court, attended but with three Servants a piece at the moſt; and at the ſame time let there be ſommoned to appear alſo all perſons whatſoever, that are the ableſt, and beſt ſeen in the affaires and Secrets of State, and of Government: and there let him command them to propoſe, every one of them ſeverally, what they conceive moſt advantageous for the promoting of the Greatneſſe of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Monarchy, or elſe for the particular Benefit of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces: and withal to give notice, what Errours have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118554:32"/>been there committed to that very time, which it concernes the Publick ſhould be rectified. And I would have all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours alſo of all the ſeveral Councells to be preſent at this aſſembly, that every one of them in particular may be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what concerns the whole World, and may take notice by this meanes wherein he committed any Error for the laſt Seven yeares, and ſo may either be reproved for the ſame, or may otherwiſe receive the praiſe due to him. For, if this Courſe were taken, the Counſellours of the Several Councels, growing Wiſer and more Circumſpect, would take heed how they gave any either Unworthy, or Unprofitable Counſels: and the King himſelf would have a greater inſight into the Condition of his Monarchy, and by diſcovering New Secrets, and Myſteries of State, ſhould thereby find out waies of advancing his own Greatneſſe more and more every day: and the Nobles alſo would ſet their braines to work all that Seven years ſpace, to find by what means their Princes State might be the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and would not any longer continue in their former Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and both they, and the reſt of the learned of the Kingdom would utter the Virulency of their Ambition, not by their Sword, but by their Tongue. Now there is none ſo weak, but is able to deliver in words the State of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick: ſeeing that there is no Philoſopher, but will undertake out of his own brain to give a deſcription, or Model of the ſame: Whence indeed are ſcattered abroad the ſeeds of Hereſy and Sedition. But by the taking of this courſe, when any of theſe kind of Perſons hath hopes of being rewarded by the Prince, he will conceive it his beſt way to expect rather to be called to give his Judgment at the Septennial Aſſembly, or elſe to ſend it thither in writing, and ſo will ſuppreſſe his Opinions till that time. And ſo by this meanes the King ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the more ſecure of the Obedience of his Nobility, and ſhall underſtand who they are that deſerve either well or ill of Him: Neither ſhall He be deceived, and abuſed by his Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Flatterers; and ſhall have the better Opportunity of calling his Miniſters of State to an account, for their evill Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Provinces they were ſet over; and ſhall withal very much mend the condition of the ſaid Provinces, and ſhall find many other Advantages to follow hereupon, which I am not at preſent able to reckon up; and ſhall beſides bring it ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118554:33"/>to paſſe, that his Councel ſhall be both the Wiſer, and withal the Truer to Him. But the Nobles of the New World, in caſe they cannot make their perſonal appearance at this Meeting, may ſend others in their places: Which is the Cuſtome that the Clergy, being inſtructed by a certain Divine Wiſdome, have alwaies obſerved in their <hi>General Chapters:</hi> though no Monarch, or State, hath ever taken the ſaid courſe, except it be the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> whoſe Embaſſadours, when they return home from any Forreign parts, are to give an account in the Senate of what they found Obſervable in the ſeveral Countries whither they were imployed.</p>
               <p>Now although our Diſcourſe here hath been concerning the Particular Councels, and Kingdoms, that belong to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> onely; yet we may not therefore omit to ſay ſomething of <hi>Councels</hi> in general; ſeeing that it is certain, <hi>That More Weighty Affaires are Effected by Good Conduct and Counſels, then by Weapons and Hands.</hi> But becauſe a Diſſertation of this nature, being beſides the intention of our preſent deſign, would be too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe, I ſhall only here touch at ſome few particulars.</p>
               <p>Such Counſels as are too Subtile, and Nice, are not much to be regarded; becauſe they ſeldom are brought to any good Iſſue: for by how much the greater Subtlety there is in them, ſo much the more Exactneſſe, and Punctuality is there required in the Execution of them; which is a buſineſſe of the greateſt difficulty that can be. And hence it is that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not ſo Ingenious a People as the <hi>Florentines,</hi> yet are they more happy, for the moſt part, in their Conſultations, then They are; as of old, the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar more Fortunate, then the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe Counſels are not to be much regarded, that have no matter of Weight or Eminency in them; Yet much leſſe are ſuch to be eſteemed that aime at too Vaſt and Immenſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; ſuch as for the moſt part were thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and Pope-<hi>Leo</hi> X. the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof required both a better Purſe, a longer Life, and greater Abilities then either of them had; which kind of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings are very pernicious to a State, or Kingdom. All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperate Counſells are likewiſe Dangerous; and are commonly attended by Deſpaire and Miſery. It remaineth therefore, that thoſe Counſells are chiefly to be Embraced, that have the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118554:33"/>greateſt both Facility, and Security in them; and ſuch as are well grounded, and upon Mature deliberation reſolved upon, and as little ſubject, as may be, to Caſualties, and the power of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Slow Counſels become Great Princes; for it concerns them to be more careful in the Preſerving, and making good, then in the Enlarging of the Bounds of their Kingdomes. But thoſe <hi>Counſels</hi> that are deſigned rather for the Acquiring of More, then the Preſerving only of what they have, muſt be more Quick, and Sudden. But of this ſubject I have elſewhere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed more largely.</p>

And thus in Small Countries Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice is not obſerved: for theſe men, while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to enlarge the Kings Juriſdiction, they render him odious to his people, and in the mean time fleece the poor, miſerable Subjects. Therefore let every Officer provide himſelf to render an Account of his Adminiſtration to the People, who are to give in Information to the King every ten yeares, where they have been honeſtly dealt with, and where not.</p>
               <p>All Falſe Witneſſes alſo, of whom the World is ſo full, muſt likewiſe be ſeverely puniſhed: and there muſt be care taken alſo, that the Atturnies of the Exchequer may not force men by threatning words, and ſometimes by blowes too, to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118554:34"/>for them. But the beſt Courſe would be, that the Law of <hi>Retaliation</hi> ſhould be in force; that the Complaint that makes not good his Accuſation, ſhould ſuffer the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the other ſhould have done, if found guilty: becauſe that now adaies there are more Calumnies brought into Courts, then Juſt Accuſations. And therefore any Lawyer that ſhall be found to have ſuborned any ſuch Witneſſe; or any Judge, that ſhall be proved to have taken any Bribe, to pervert the Lawes, ſhould be debarred for ever after, either from pleading at any Bar, or giving ſentence in any Court.</p>
               <p>The King muſt alſo take care, that Judges give ſentence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies according to the Lawes, and not according as Policy of State (as they uſe to ſpeak) ſhall require: and afterward either the King himſelf, or his <hi>Viceroy,</hi> or any other of the Kings Miniſters may mitigate the Rigour of the Law, as they ſhall ſee cauſe, (provided it be not in Caſe of High Treaſon) that by this meanes they may gain the more upon the Peoples Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And that untoward Cuſtome is to be rooted out of the minds of Ordinary Judges, which yet hath taken deeper root in the minds of the Superiour Judges alſo; namely, that although they know an accuſed perſon to be Innocent, yet they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, though it be in a matter of no Moment; to the end that the fault may at laſt light upon Him, after the buſineſſe hath been a good while depending under the Judge; that ſo, (as they uſe to ſay) there may ſeem to have been Pregnant Reaſons for the long depending of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Whereas they ſhould be ſo far from aggravating any fault, as that they ſhould rather leſſen it as much as may be: and ſo they ſhould endeavour the rather to be really Juſt, then to get an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of being ſo; to the great detriment of the People, and alſo of the King himſelf; who through the wickedneſſe of theſe Unjuſt Judges, who are hated both by God, and Himſelf, is deprived of the Love and Affections of his People; which is the main Prop of His Affaires: and beſides, Good Men, having loſt their reputation, deſire to change their preſent ſtate for a better; as we ſee it uſually comes to paſſe.</p>
               <p>And no people have opportunity of offending more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and cloſely, then your Inferiour Officers have; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe men, the more in favour they are with the Prince,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118554:34"/>the more grievouſly are they wont to aggravate mens crimes. And therefore in this caſe there ought to be certain Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at all times deputed, and the ſame alſo to be maintained at the Charge of the ſaid Miniſters, who ſhall yearly alſo lay down a certain ſumme of Mony to be kept in ſome Common place, for the charges of the next Commiſſaries the following year, that by theſe their Books of Accounts may be examined during the time of their being in Office, or afterwards alſo, if need be. For, by reaſon of the Corruption of theſe Inferiour Officers, whole Provinces have many times heretofore fallen off from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; eſpecially when they have been found to be too ambitious, and active in ſqueezing the Subjects, either for the enriching of the Publick Treaſury, or elſe for the filling of their own private Coffers. And for this reaſon it was, that the <hi>Parthians,</hi> having killed <hi>Craſſus,</hi> filled his mouth full of Melted Gold: as a certain Spaniſh Grandee was alſo ſerved by ſome <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>New World.</hi> And certainly Covetouſneſſe, and an open, barefaced Deſire of Gold, was the reaſon, that the Affaires of the Spaniards ſucceeded ſo ill in the <hi>New World,</hi> into which at firſt they had ſo miraculous an Entrance: and that the other Nations there, perceiving that humour in them, ſtood upon their guard as well as they could againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whoſe Government notwithſtanding, before, they had not refuſed. The ſame manner of proceeding alſo in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> was the cauſe of the ruining of the Spaniſh Affaires there.</p>
               <p>Let all <hi>Criminal Cauſes,</hi> in times of Peace, be protracted as much as may be: (For, <hi>No delay, about the death of any man, can ever be too long:</hi>) but this muſt not be in times of War.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end that ſo vaſt a Monarchy may not fall to decay, hath need of ſuch men as are excellent both for Learning, and the practiſe of Armes; whom He ought to reward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with Baronies; that ſo being from thenceforth made ſharers, as it were, of the ſaid Monarchy, they may to their utmoſt power endeavour to maintain, and make good the ſame to their Prince. Which Baronies not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, when they once fall into the hands of Unworthy perſons, are the cauſe of much miſchief. And they do fall into ſuch hands, when they come to be beſtowed either upon Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons, or perhaps ſuch Exchequer Men, as have found out new waies of oppreſſing the Subject: or elſe, when they have been conferred at firſt upon Wiſe, and Valiant men; whoſe Succeſſors for all that may have proved to be Mean, Inconſiderable perſons; or are elſe riotous, and proud; and ſuch, as laying aſide all thought of their Anceſtors Virtue, take the full enjoyment only of that they have left them, and having no worth of their own, can onely boaſt of the Nobility of their Anceſtors. And hence it is, that the King is in want ſo much of Perſons of Worth, whileſt the number of ſuch Uſeleſſe Drones encreaſeth in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Great <hi>Turk,</hi> that he may prevent the latter of theſe Miſchiefs, putting by all ſuch as are bottom'd only upon Others Nobility, takes notice of ſuch onely as are Eminent for ſome worth of their own: Neither doth he ſuffer any ſon to ſucceed in the Eſtate, or Goods of his Father by Right of Inheritance; but he is to receive the ſame at his hands, as a reward of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if ſo be he deſerve it. But in caſe he do not, he muſt then ſerve him either in ſome Ignoble Art, or elſe in ſome inferiour Office in his Wars.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:118554:35"/>
               <p>The Former of theſe Inconveniences any King of Spain may prevent, if he but confer theſe rewards upon ſuch onely, as are deſerving Perſons; but the Remedy of the Second, which is practiſed by the Turks cannot be made uſe of among Chriſtians. Onely let him be ſure that many of theſe Baronies do not in time fall into the hands of one man, who perhaps upon the firſt Opportunity given may revolt from him; as did the Nobility of <hi>Japan,</hi> who being grown great in power, made oppoſition againſt their King in the City <hi>Meaco,</hi> which was alſo done by the Barons of <hi>France,</hi> who thereby hindered their own Monarchy; and as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did to the <hi>Turk:</hi> and ſo likewiſe the Princes of <hi>Tarentum</hi> and <hi>Salerne,</hi> and many other in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> who made the ſame Attempts againſt their Kings, both thoſe of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and of <hi>Anjou</hi> too. Now the Miſcheifs which theſe Barons bring upon the People, and conſequently upon their King, are theſe. They come to <hi>Naples,</hi> and to the Court, and there ſpending their mony profuſely and laviſhly, they make a great ſhew for a while, and get in favour with the Kings friends; and at length having ſpent all, they return poor home, and make prey of whatſoever they can, that ſo they may make themſelves whole again; and then they return to Court again; running round ſtill, as it were, in the ſame Circle; in ſo much that we ſee theſe mens Territories much more deſert, and naked, then the Kings in <hi>Italy</hi> are; all through the default of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons themſelves. And then, if the People have been infeſted with any Peſtilential Diſeaſes, or have ſuffered by the <hi>Turks;</hi> They preſently beg of the King to have the yearly Taxes to be remitted for ſome certain time; the payment whereof they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves require at the hands of the People, and in the Kings name too, and that with all the ſeverity that may be: which the Prince of <hi>Rogebo</hi> had the confidence to do, after the battel with the <hi>Turks.</hi> And laſtly, under the pretence of the <hi>Camera,</hi> (as they call it,) that is to ſay, that the Country may be freed from quartering of Souldiers, they extort from the Subjects many Thouſands of Crownes. And they find out a Thouſand other wayes of fleecing the poor Subjects, that ſo they may never want Supplies either for their Luxury, or their Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And notwithſtanding that the Spaniards believe, that this Laviſhneſſe of theirs makes for the Kings Advantage, and renders his ſtate the more ſecure; becauſe that thoſe that are ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118554:36"/>given to rioting and Luxury, are never any gatherers, and hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers up of vaſt Sums of Mony which may prove the Inſtruments of Rebellion; yet the plain truth of it is, they do him much hurt: for they by this meanes reduce the People, from whom the greateſt part of the Kings Revenues come, to a poor, low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For the remedying of which Miſcheif, it would do well if there were a Law made; that no Baron ſhould have above 3000. Crowenes of yearly Revenues: and that whatſoever any of them hath more, it ſhould not deſcend to his Succeſſor, but ſhould go after him to the Exchequer: I ſpeak here onely of ſuch Baronies as ſhall be conferred by the King, upon the Grounds aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>As for the Ancienter Barons, it would do well if there were ſome Competitions cheriſhed among them, that by this means, by their contentions they might keep one another under: and ſo likewiſe, that at every Seven years end there ſhould be ſuch an Aſſembly called together, as I ſpake of before: and that the Barons ſhould be freed from all Bonds. Likewiſe, that every Baron ſhould every three years find the King as many Souldiers and Horſes, as he hath Thouſands of Crowns of yearly Revenue. Let him alſo divide the Tittles of Honour; and beſides, he may do well to create many New Lords, finding out for them New Titles; that ſo the ſmalneſſe of their number may not encreaſe their dignity and honour. Let Him take care alſo, that the Lordſhips, and Lords Mannours of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> may be bougt by Forraigners; that is to ſay, by the <hi>Genueſe, Florentines, French,</hi> and <hi>Venetians;</hi> that ſo the Barons, that are the Natives, may be brought lower, and the Forreigners may bring the King in a large yearly Revenue out of their own Country Lordſhips. By which means I dare be bold to affirm, that the King ſhall have greater power, and Command at <hi>Genoa,</hi> then at <hi>Millan;</hi> becauſe that nothing can be done, or reſolved upon at <hi>Genoa,</hi> without his knowledge and conſent; whiles the <hi>Genueſes</hi> will alwayes be in fear of loſing the Lordſhips they have in the King of Spains dominions. And by this means alſo the King ſhall not need to trouble himſelf about allowing them maintenance, as he is with the <hi>Millanois:</hi> for, <hi>Whoſever is fed by thee, he is thy ſervant.</hi> And thus have the <hi>Florentines</hi> alwaies been ſervants to the King of <hi>France,</hi> into whoſe Dominions they have liberty of Traffick allowed them.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:118554:36"/>
               <p>But there muſt be care taken, that no Fortified Places be ever put into the hands of any of the Barons. And beſides, there muſt be ſuch Proviſion made, as that all the Sons of the ſaid Barons ſhould have Spaniards for their Tutors, who ſhall Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniolize them, and train them up to the Habit, Manners, and Garbe of the Spaniard. And when theſe Barons ſhall once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grow Powerful, He muſt take them down; yet under the pretenſe of honouring them, by ſending them away to ſome Office, or Charge, that lies in ſome place far remote from their own Lordſhips, and where they ſhall be ſure to ſpend more then they get. And again, when ever the King ſhall pleaſe to take his Progreſſe into the Country, let him ſo contrive his <hi>Giſts,</hi> as that He may lye upon theſe Barons; and ſo under the pretext of doing them Honour, may force them to be at a great charge in entertaining Him. Let Him give a willing ear to the People, when they make any complaints of them. Neither ought <hi>Nobility</hi> to be higher prized by the King, then <hi>Virture;</hi> which is a Rule that deſerves to be obſerved above all the reſt. Beſides, in all the Metropolian Cities in his ſeveral Kingdomes, as at <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, Toledo, Antwerp,</hi> and the reſt, as well in this, as in the other Hemiſphere, the King under pretext of doing them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may Conſtitute, in each of them, five, eight, or ten Ranks, or Orders of Barons; ſuch as are at <hi>Naples;</hi> that when they are to treat of any Affairs of State, each of them may go into his own Order and Place. For being thus divided, they will never be able to determine any thing that ſhall be Prejudicial to the King, by reaſon of the Ambition that will be amongſt them, and ſo, where there ſhall be three Lawes perhaps made, to the Kings prejudice, there will alwaies be eight made for his advantage. And the common People alſo may in like manner, be diſtributed into their ſeveral <hi>Claſſes</hi> and Ranks. And this is much the more honourable, and ſecure way, then to cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and ſidings into parties among them, which is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of ſome Writers, who have a Saying, <hi>Divide, &amp; impera:</hi> Cauſe Diviſions among thy ſubjects, and thou ſhalt rule them well enough.</p>
               <p>The King muſt alwayes make much of ſuch perſons, as are of eminent either Valour, or Virtue, and muſt prefer them to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and honours. In every place alſo, where He hath any <hi>Councel</hi> ſitting, He ought to joyn to them one of ſome <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:118554:37"/>Order or other, whom he can truſt; and that, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſecurity of both parties, both Prince, and Counſellour. And all ſuch perſons as ſhall be admitted to this honour, ſhould have an Oath adminiſtred unto them, or elſe ſhould have ſome kind of Obligation by way of ſome Religious Fraternity with the Crown, by which they ſhould be bound, in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and perillous times, not only to deliver into the Kings hands all the Gold and Silver they have, but that themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall in perſon ſerve in the Wars, in defence of the Fortune and ſafety of the Kingdom. By which means the King ſhall prevent all Inſurrections among them: or in caſe they ſhould ſtirr, He ſhall have a ſufficient Pledge in his hands, as being poſſeſſed of all their Treaſures; in ſo much that their Wives will not ſpare in this caſe, to bring in what Rings, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Chains of Gold, or any thing elſe of value that they have, (as we read, the Roman women did, when Rome was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and other Enemies,) and lay them all at the Kings feet.</p>
               <p>And as for Commanders in War, thoſe he ought to account the beſt, that were themſelves once common Souldiers; ſuch as <hi>Antonius de Leva,</hi> and <hi>Gonſalvus de Corduba</hi> were; as thoſe Counſellours alſo are to be eſteemed the ableſt, that have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to that height from the loweſt, and meaneſt Truſts and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. And therefore the King ſhall not take any great care for ſuch Barons, as have not been in ſervice abroad before, ſo that they may have thereby rendred themſelves fit to diſcharge the offices of able Commanders in War, or to ſerve the King in his Councells. But he muſt get about him ſuch, as have been men of long Experience, and are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and verſed in the Affaires of the World.</p>
               <p>Neither is it a ſmall Calamity, that the Kingdom of Spain lieth under, by reaſon of ſuch Quarells, and Suits of Law as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ariſe among the Nobility, about <hi>Precedency,</hi> as they call it: which certainly, in the time of War, muſt needs be of moſt dangerous conſequence; for There, <hi>Military Valour</hi> is onely to be looked after. And who knowes, whether or no this very thing might not be the cauſe of the Miſcarriage of the <hi>Armado</hi> that was ſent againſt England in the year 1588. But herein the Barons are of great uſe, and advantage to the King, becauſe that in caſe He ſhall have any ill ſucceſſe in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118554:37"/>He can immediately make himſelf whole again by his Barons: which the <hi>Turks</hi> can not do. For when he hath once received but one notable Blow, and is now much weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, He hath no Barons left him, by whoſe aide he may recover himſelf again: which was the caſe alſo of <hi>Darius,</hi> when he was overthrown by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and of the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt</hi> that was conquered by <hi>Selim;</hi> both which being once beaten, were never afterward able to make head again againſt their Enemy. And if ſo be that Emulation and Envy had not born too great a ſway among the Chriſtians, in that Memoral Victory obtained at Sea againſt he <hi>Turk,</hi> in the year 71. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> might at that time have tbeen recovered, and the <hi>Turk</hi> utterly rooted out.</p>
               <p>The King muſt therefore take eſpecial notice, wherein the Barons may be prejudicial to Him, and in what they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Him: and He muſt make uſe of them rather as his Treaſurers of his Arms, and Monies, then make them, as it were, the Patrons of His State. And yet out of theſe Treaſurers of his he may chooſe out ſome to be Commanders in his War; provided, that he lay a Command upon them to ſet aſide their Second Sons, to be as a Seminary of Military Valour both for Sea, and Land Service; as we ſhall ſhew hereafter: and by this means He ſhall have their Fathers, the Barons themſelves, as it were bound to be faithful to him, by reaſon of this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Sons to the Prince; and ſo He ſhall be ſure to have them at his devotion, whenſoever he ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of them: as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter, in the Chapter <hi>Of Navigation.</hi>

And hence it is, that the <hi>Franks, Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Heruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and other Northern People, have alwaies abounded with plenty of Men: In ſo much that by reaſon of the too narrow Limits of their own Countries, they have been fain to leave them, and to ſeek for places of Habitation in ours, and other Countries; and have like Bees, been continually ſending forth freſh Colonies into other parts: by which means we ſee it hath come to paſſe. that the <hi>Oriental</hi> Nations, together with the <hi>Grecian, Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> are now in a manner quite extinct. And therefore the Spaniards, being but few in Number, have been forced, for the reaſons afore alleadged, quite to clear all the places whatſoever, that they conquered, of their ancient Inhabitants, as appears by the courſe they took with the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>New World;</hi> leaſt otherwiſe they ſhould have lived in a continual fear, that the conquered, who were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118554:38"/>much the greater number, might riſe up and take armes againſt. their Conquerors. And this is the reaſon, why by the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant they are accounted Cruel, Mercileſſe people, for ſuch their proceeding againſt the Indians. The number of the ſubjects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and the Revenues of the Crown are by this means dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; neither will any Nation that is Populous, endure to hear of the Spaniards: who for the ſame cauſe endeavouring this way to bring into the <hi>Netherlands</hi> alſo, became moſt hateful among them. And this Courſe is the King of Spain at this day fain to take in <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily:</hi> for he hath not above five Thouſand Spaniards to keep thoſe ſo large Kingdomes in Obedience.</p>
               <p>And indeed thoſe Dominions are upheld, and made good to the Spaniard meerely through Opinion onely. And for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon are they forced to diſarme the People; which cauſeth them to ſuſpect Tyranny, and Inhumanity from them; and which makes many alſo forſake their Country; as Solon told <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Beſides, ſeeing they are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to treat the Subjects hardly, they are therefore fain to get <hi>Switzers</hi> about them for their Life-guards; as not daring to truſt their perſons with thoſe, whoſe hatred they have for theſe reaſons contracted; which was alſo the diſcourſe of the ſame <hi>Solon</hi> to the aforeſaid Tyrant of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another meanes, and cauſe why Spain ſhould want Souldiers, is, becauſe that the Spaniards, when ever they conquer any Country that abounds with all manner of delights, they do ſo give themſelves up to the full injoyment of thoſe delights, that they thereby ſoften, and enervate themſelves; and laying aſide all their Innate fierceneſſe, and yet withal ſecurety relying upon their own ſtrengths alone, they are eaſily driven out thence again. For this cauſe the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they ſaw their Army ro be grown Effeminate, and much weakned, by lying in <hi>Campania,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Pleaſures thereof, they preſently reformed it. And at <hi>Naples</hi> they never had any Native for their King, by reaſon of the Delicacy of the Aire there, and Venereal Pleaſures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all their Manly Courage, and Gallantry of Spirit is ſoftened, and taken down. Neither could any Forreigners ever keep it long; becauſe that in proceſſe of time they became cheap in the Peoples Eyes, and ſo became a prey to other Forreigners; as the <hi>Viſcardians</hi> were to the <hi>Suevians,</hi> the <hi>Suevians</hi> to thoſe of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118554:39"/>
                  <hi>Anjou,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to the <hi>Arraganians,</hi> and at length to the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Caſtilians:</hi> who afterwards, under the Command of the <hi>Great Captain</hi> drove the French out of the ſaid Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The like hath alſo happened to all thoſe Fierce Nothern Nations, that have heretofore poſſeſſed themſelves of any Southern Countries; for through the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and delights of the ſaid Countries, they have at length become Effeminate, and broken in their ſtrength. And by this meanes the <hi>Herulians</hi> became a Prey to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> to the <hi>Grecians:</hi> as the <hi>Lombards</hi> were to the <hi>French:</hi> and as at length it befell to the <hi>Vandalls</hi> alſo, and <hi>Hunnes.</hi> Thus the <hi>Tartarians</hi> in like manner became the Laughing-ſtock, and Scorn of the <hi>Turks;</hi> but indeed the Turk now defends himſelf by his Guards of theſe Northern People, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>After He had once perceived, that the Courage of his own Nation began to cool, He preſently erected certain Seminaries of Souldiers (they call them <hi>Seragli,</hi> that is to ſay, Cloyſters, or Encloſures,) into which he ſhut up all the likelieſt, and ableſt-bodied young boyes of all the Nations that he had conquered; where they ſhould be taken off from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Parents; and ſhould be accuſtomed to reverence, and own the Grand Signiour only, as their Father: and here they are alſo inſtructed in all Military Arts, and in the Turkiſh Religion; and out of theſe doth the Great <hi>Turk</hi> chooſe his <hi>Janizaries,</hi> for the guard of his own Perſon; and of theſe ſame <hi>Janizaries</hi> doth He afterwards make his <hi>Baſhawes,</hi> that is, his Commanders, and Counſellours in his Wars; as alſo the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of his Provinces, and Baronies; and ſuch of theſe as He finds to be ſtudiouſly inclined, and fit for the Book, he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of them the <hi>Mufties,</hi> and the <hi>Cadies,</hi> that is to ſay, the Prieſts, and Judges. So that although the race of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould faile, yet will he never be unprovided of an able Souldiery; ſeeing that He takes ſuch an order to have ſuch brought up thus for his ſervice in every Province, by the Preſidents of the ſaid Provinces.</p>
               <p>And the Romans of old, to the end that they might never want Souldiers, propoſed great rewards, and Honours for all ſuch as ſhould approve themſelves Valiant in War. Hence we read,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118554:39"/>that <hi>Ventidius, Marius,</hi> and other Valiant and Wiſe perſons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to ſo great a height of Renown among them; till at length by this means they made themſelves Maſters of the Whole World.</p>
               <p>The King of Spain therefore, to the end that He may remove from his Souldiery theſe two Evils, which It chiefly laboureth under, muſt make uſe of theſe two Arts eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He muſt preſently take away from all People that he ſhall conquer, all their Immovable Goods, and muſt allow them only food and cloathing, and ſo ſet them to manure the ground; and as for their Sons, He may make them either Souldiers, or Husband men, according as he ſhall find them fitteſt for either of theſe Imployments. And this will be beſt done in ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as He ſhall have brought into his Subjection upon ſome certain Occaſion: according as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his advantage by Occaſion of the unexpected Dearth that aroſe there, to the end that the People might the better be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Corn, he cauſed them to put all they had into their King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hands: from whom the <hi>Turks</hi> alſo have learnt this Art. But there will be need of a very Wiſe Man, that may be able to bring this about in our Country, by taking good and plauſible Occaſions of doing the ſame: Or elſe the King may conſtitute ſome Third Perſon, as an Intermediate Lawgiver, (ſuch as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in <hi>Egypt;</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> who was ſent for into <hi>Sicily</hi> by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant) by whoſe means He may, in each ſeveral Province, reforme the Politie of three or five Cities there; the examples whereof the reſt will afterwards follow of their own accord, when they ſhall but once take notice of the Benefits and Advantages that ſuch a Reformation brings along with it. And therefore for this end and purpoſe, there muſt be care taken eſpecially for the providing of Wiſe, and Able Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for theſe places: and I my ſelf have a certain Secret to communicate, which would much promote this buſineſſe; which I ſhall reſerve for the Kings own Ear.</p>
               <p>Or if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have a purpoſe and reſolution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Courſe already begun, (although it ſeems not to be ſo proper a one for the <hi>New World</hi>) my Opinion is, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Multitude of his conquered Vaſſals there, and the Small Number of his Souldiers in compariſon of them; He ought to take this Courſe.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:118554:40"/>
               <p>Firſt of all, let Him ſhew himſelf bountiful to the People, by remitting their Taxes, by mitigating the ſeverity of the Lawes, and by removing all occaſions that the Inferiour Officers might have of ſeizing upon the Subjects Goods; and reſtraining the Souldiers from abuſing the Inhabitants where they come; for which very reaſons the People do not get ſo many Children as otherwiſe they would, which might afterwards do the King ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>And hence alſo it is, that their Daughters, wanting good portions to put them off, are fain to become either Nunnes, or Whores; and the Men, to turn Prieſts, or Friers, or Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; and ſo to ſerve as Souldiers in other Countries. And therefore it would be much the better courſe to uſe them more Courteouſly; and to take this for a moſt certain Truth, That <hi>Mony</hi> doth not give Men Dominion over their Enemies; but rather expoſeth them as a Prey to others. And therefore the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is in a very great Errour, (as we ſhall hereafter ſhew,) while he thinks, that <hi>Mony</hi> hath the Command of All the World: Whereas in truth, it is thy <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> and thy <hi>Souldiers</hi> that muſt make Thee Lord over thine Enemies, and not thy <hi>Mony.</hi> For, the Only Uſe of <hi>Mony,</hi> is, to procure, and maintain Souldiers with it. It is much better therefore, that Souldiers ſhould bear rule over any Country, then Mony: for by this means mutual Amity, and friendſhip will be the better preſerved betwixt the Souldier and the Subject. And to this purpoſe it would be much a ſafer courſe, if there were a Law made, both in <hi>Spain,</hi> and other places, that the Eldeſt Sons only ſhould inherit their Fathers Eſtates, and the reſt ſhould all ſerve the King, and be Penſioners to Him; then ſo ſeverely to ſqueeze out of the People ſuch vaſt Summes of Mony as the Kings Miniſters do.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, I would have ſome courſe to be taken for the promoting of Peoples Marrying, by the denying of ſome certain Honours and Priviledges to all ſuch, who, being arrived to the Age of One and Twenty years, (unleſſe they be Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,) do not marry: for by this means the ſummes required for Virgins <hi>Portions</hi> in Marriage, which hath now rendred the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Matrimony very hard, will be abated. And this is one of the Principal Elements of advancing a Common-Wealth, and was much made uſe of by the <hi>Romans.</hi> It would do very well
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118554:40"/>alſo, if a Law were made, that the daughters of no Tradeſmen, or Husbandmen, ſhould bring above a Hundred Crowns to their Husbands for their Portions: and that within the compaſs of this Law ſhould be included all thoſe alſo, who have informer times ever been Tradeſmen, or Mechanical perſons. For now adaies, when any one hath ſcraped together but a Hundred Crowns, he preſently puts the ſame out to uſe, and looks ever after to be called a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> quite bidding Adieu to his Profeſſion; and thus the Kings Tributes are diminiſhed, not without the loſſe and detriment of the reſt of their fellow Subjects. But a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and wiſe Law-maker will be able to provide well enough againſt all theſe things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let the King give leave to his Souldiers to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Women in the <hi>Low-Countries, England,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and carry them away with them by force; which they may afterwards make their Wives, according as any of them ſhall be invited to do ſo by Mutual Love: and theſe Women thus caught up, I would have to be maintained at the Kings Charge; who, for this cauſe, muſt enlarge the Souldiers pay. But all theſe things are to be ſo ordered, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Women be married to <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Women either to <hi>Germans,</hi> or <hi>Low-Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women to <hi>Italians.</hi> For this the Law of Nature ſeems to require, that the Heat of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more fruitful by the <hi>German</hi> Juycineſſe; and that the Fiery Temper of the <hi>African</hi> ſhould be attempered, and allayed by the Cold and Moyſt Conſtitution of the <hi>Netherlander;</hi> that ſo both Venereal Deſires, and Fecundity too, may be the more excited, and procured; as I have formerly ſhewed in My <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> And as concerning this Temperament, the <hi>Italians</hi> are good for both.</p>
               <p>And from hence will ariſe two Advantages; the Firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that theſe Women will embrace the Chriſtian Faith: for, a Woman will never be of any other Religion then that which her Husband, whom ſhe loves ſo dearly, is of: As your Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Women, who are naturally cold, love their South-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Husbands, who are hot: and the <hi>Sabine</hi> Young Women made peace betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> their Raviſhers, and the <hi>Sabines</hi> their Parents, that came to demand them of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to have them home again. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118554:41"/>Wife is ſanctified by her Believing Husband; and ſo on the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Second Advantage is, that by this meanes the King ſhall never be without good ſtore of Souldiers, while He ſhall alwaies have his Souldiers Sons alſo to make Souldiers of. When therefore He ſhall once come to abound in Souldiers by reaſon of this courſe taken to promote Fructification, which I have now laid down; it will be a means to inflame the Souldiers minds, and will exceedingly encourage them to go on againſt any Garriſons, or Fortified places of the Enemy, that ſo they may get themſelves handſome women for their Wives, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward may lye ſtill, and take their eaſe. And this was a Secret of <hi>Plato's</hi> finding out, that Souldiers ſhould be ſtirred up, and encouraged to fight for Love. I would alſo have a Law made, that ſuch Souldiers, as have taken away more Women then one, ſhould be placed in ſome ſtrong Holds, and keep Gariſon there; and not be forced to follow the Camp: in like manner as at <hi>Naples,</hi> all thoſe Souldiers that are married, are put into the Forts there: and it would do very well if ſuch were ſent away into ſome New Colonies of the <hi>New World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, let Him cauſe to be erected in each of his ſeveral Dominions, (as namely in <hi>Spain, Naples,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> &amp;c. two, or four <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Souldiers, into which ſhall be put poor Mens Sons only, and Baſtards; which ſhall be here trained up to the Exerciſe of Armes; acknowledging the King for their father, and none elſe: and theſe, after they are once grown up to be liſted for Souldiers, ſhall go and ſeize upon Women where they can, in an enemies Country, which they may make their Wives. And this will be a means to encourage poor people to get children as faſt as they can, as being certainly provided of one that will breed them up for them; and the King alſo ſhall by this means be ſure to have faithful Souldiers. But in Forreign Nations, let Him erect for every ſeveral Nation a ſeveral <hi>Seminary;</hi> as for Example, let there be one for the <hi>Moors,</hi> and another for the Sons of the <hi>Low-Dutch:</hi> all which He ſhall cauſe to be brought up in Military Diſcipline, as the Great <hi>Turk</hi> doth his <hi>Janizaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And beſides, there ſhould be certain poor women maintained in the ſaid <hi>Seminaries</hi> at the Kings Charge, who ſhall make the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118554:41"/>Souldiers beds, or may Spin and Weave cloath for the making of Sailes, or the like. Then again, that ſuch as are too near of kin may not marry, contrary to the Orders of the Church; and withal, that thoſe Marriages that are made, may prove the more fruitful, I would have <hi>Italian</hi> Women to be married to thoſe that are of the <hi>Seminaries</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or of <hi>Spain.</hi> For by this means alſo, there will not ſo many Idle perſons enter themſelves into Religious Orders, as there do, who are a great burthen to the Church; for as much as theſe Men make choice of this kind of Life, not out of any ſenſe of Religion, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being forced out of neceſſity; and ſo are a Scandal to the reſt; and beſides, the King is alſo hereby prejudiced, who by this means hath both the fewer Vaſſals, and Souldiers, and the ſmaller Subſidies alſo.</p>
               <p>There may alſo be educated in theſe Cloyſters, or Colledges, or call them what you pleaſe, people of all Nations whatſoever: for the maintenace of whom there may Revenues be taken out of the Allowances of Almes-houſes, and Hoſpitals appointed for the Maintenance of Old Men, or of any other honeſt Men; or of ſuch Friers, as by preaching about the Country get enough to ſuſtain themſelves; and toward this Charge there may be ſomething exacted of all Uſurers, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Kings Treaſure.</hi> And by this means the Kings Revenue will be ſo far from being diminiſhed, that if He do lay out any thing of his own, He will rather prove a gainer by it.</p>
               <p>But now, it would be very advantagious for <hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Low-Country</hi> Women, and ſo make up one Family betwixt them: for by this meanes the whole World would by little and little be brought to embrace the Manners and Garbe of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and ſo would the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilier be brought into ſubjection. And thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers that are at <hi>Naples</hi> are in an errour, while they ſeek onely for <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women to make Wives of: and therefore the Vice-Roy there ſhould ſee, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women ſhould have <hi>Italians,</hi> or <hi>Netherlanders</hi> for their Husbands; on whom He ſhould confer all the honours he can; eſpecially, where theſe Marriages happen to be among the Barons, or other perſons of quality.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:118554:42"/>
               <p>Neither let any one think, that thoſe <hi>Seragli,</hi> or Cloyſters among the <hi>Turks,</hi> before ſpoken of, are a meere fiction: for this moſt excellent Deſign hath been practiſed in the Church ever ſince the Apoſtles time: and we ſee how many Colledges for young Students the Pope hath, both of <hi>Germans, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Maronites;</hi> that are as ſo many <hi>Seminaries</hi> of the <hi>Faith.</hi> And then, the <hi>Orders</hi> of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and the reſt, are nothing elſe, but <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Apoſtolical Souldiers, who uſing no Armes, but their Tongue only, do bring the World in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: And Theſe are the very Nerves of the Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The Pope likewiſe promotes Men of all Nations to the Dignities both of Prieſts, Biſhops, and Cardinals, having no reſpect either to Rich or Poor, <hi>Barbarian</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> (as the Apoſtle himſelf commanded) if ſo be they be but Wiſe, and Good Men. And hence it is, that His Dominion is ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and ſo united within it ſelf; namely through <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>New World, Africk,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as well as in <hi>Italy;</hi> and that by reaſon only of the Common Tie of Religion, and the Union of Men and Minds.</p>
               <p>And therefore the King, whoſe deſign it is to procure an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation not of his Subjects Fortunes onely, but alſo of their Perſons, and Armes; unleſſe He be Powerful over their Religion too, which is the Bond of Mens Minds and Affections, He will have but a kind of an Eſtranged, and weak Dominion among them. And it is very evident, that the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> by reaſon of his Subjects being of different Religions, is of leſſe power, then either our King is, or the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> And hence it is therefore that the <hi>Turks</hi> have learnt Wiſedome, to Our Prejudice and Damage: whileſt we in the mean time tranſgreſſe againſt the Lawes of Policy, while we obſerve the <hi>Roman,</hi> or National Lawes. Wherefore the King might do, what would well become a Chriſtian, if he would cauſe to be erected Colledges of Souldiers; and would alſo promote to Military Preferments, not Spaniards only, but all Perſons of Worth and Valour whatſoever; by that means engaging them in the Spaniſh Manners, and Cuſtoms: for by ſo doing, He ſhould be beloved as well by ſtrangers, as by his own Subjects. And it is alſo conſonant to the Opinion of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> to take
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118554:42"/>and baptize, in the <hi>Seminaries,</hi> ſuch Children of Hereticks, and <hi>Moores,</hi> as have been taken from an enemy in time of War; though not to do ſo in time of peace: as, for example, to take the Children of <hi>Jewes,</hi> living at <hi>Rome,</hi> perhaps, and by force to baptize them: notwithſtanding that <hi>Scotus</hi> approves of both theſe.</p>
               <p>I would have the King likewiſe every ſeven years to pardon all ſuch as are Baniſhed Perſons, or are guilty of Murder; upon condition that they ſhall ſerve Him as Souldiers in his Warres againſt <hi>Africk,</hi> or in the <hi>New World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Him alſo make an Act, that each ſeveral Pariſh ſhall every year furniſh him out one Souldier a piece; (which is a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, Your Lordſhip ſaith, was made by a Friend of Yours in <hi>Spain;</hi>) for by this means there may be raiſed Threeſcore Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers, and more, in that Kingdom. It will therefore be very expedient, that there ſhould an Union be made up betwixt the King and the Pope, as hath been before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>But it would be better, that every Baron, at the end of ſuch a ſet term of years, ſhould bring in to the King ſuch a certain number of Souldiers: and it would be beſt of all, that the Baron himſelf alſo ſhould go in perſon to the Wars, whenſoever the King goes. And this ought to be obſerved not only in Spain, but in all other of the Kings Dominions: and likewiſe that other Rule, that only the Eldeſt ſons ſhall inherit their Fathers Eſtates in all places what ever. But all theſe Rules cannot be obſerved any where to any great purpoſe, except the Foundation of the Nations be firſt reformed, namely, in Making of Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and by erecting <hi>Seminaries,</hi> or Colledges of Souldiers; who ſhould be ſuch, as contenting themſelves with Meat, and Drink, and Cloathes onely, ſhall have the Courage, through hope of Advancement, in caſe they approve themſelves ſtout and Valiant perſons, to attempt as daringly, and adventure upon all the moſt dangerous Undertakings, and thoſe greater, then even the <hi>Turks</hi> Janizaries are wont to venture on. And let this ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the means of encreaſing the Souldiery, and againſt the Depopulating of Countries.</p>
               <p>As touching Captains, and Commanders in War, they ought not to be made out of that moſt Idle ſort of men, whom they now adaies call <hi>Nobiles,</hi> Gentlemen: but rather let the moſt Stout and Valiant perſons be choſen for this purpoſe; and ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118554:43"/>as are inclined rather to Severity, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was, then ſuch as are of a Courteous Diſpoſition, as was <hi>Scipio.</hi> And I would have theſe to be choſen out of the number of Souldiers, that have behaved themſelves valiantly in fight, and ſuch as have ſtep by ſtep got up to what places they are now in: Such as were <hi>Marius, Sylla, Ventidius, Antonio de Leva, Cicala,</hi> and <hi>Occiali.</hi> But the Perſon to whom the whole Charge of the War ſhall be committed, muſt be ſuch a one as is of very great Authority amongſt the ſouldiery, and one that is alſo of the Blood Royal. Or, if it be ſuſpected, that ſuch a one may poſſibly himſelf aſpire to the Monarchy, let there be then one choſen out of the Barons, who ſhall be found the moſt fit for this Truſt, and who is a man that is Eminent rather for Real Action, then for Shew and Oſtentation.</p>
               <p>In this caſe, that the King may proceed the more ſecurely, Let Him erect a Councel, which ſhall conſiſt of Wiſe, and Faithful perſons, with ſome of ſome Religious Order or other joyned to them; from whoſe hands the Souldiers ſhould receive their Pay. For there was nothing that did more promote the ruine of the Kings affaires in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> then the Souldiers being defrauded of their Pay. And therefore I would have thoſe to be entruſted with the charge of Paying the Souldier, that are <hi>Capuchins;</hi> becauſe that theſe men care for Mony the leaſt of any Religious Order of Friers whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And that there may never be wanting fit perſons to be made Captains, and Commanders, there ought to be certain peculiar <hi>Seminaries</hi> erected for the education of the Second, and Younger Sons of Barons, and Gentlemen; who ſhall there be inſtructed in the Art of Riding the Great Horſe, and uſing the Javeling, of raiſing Fortifications, and making aſſaults upon, and taking in of fortified places; likewiſe of marſhalling of battels, and laying of ſieges to places; alſo of managing a battel, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out an Army into Companies, and how to give the Word of Command to the Souldiers, and laſtly, how to train up freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water Souldiers: all which things <hi>Hannibal</hi> was inſtructed in, when he was yet but nine years old. But now, not onely the Souldiers having been cheated of their Pay, but alſo their Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency after a Victory, and their contempt of too mild a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, often gives them occaſion of Mutinying.</p>
               <p>And therefore they are alwaies to be divided into Regiments,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118554:43"/>and never the whole Army to lye all together, but when they are to go into the field to fight; becauſe by this meanes the fear of the Enemy will keep them in due Obedience to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. The neglect of this one thing was the cauſe of all thoſe Miſcheifs that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> felt, after the Second <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> War; and it was deſtructive alſo to the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, in the time of <hi>Furius Camillus.</hi> Let the Authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all Mutinies among the Souldiers be immediately put to death in the face of the whole Army, as <hi>Speridius</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore was; and he that cauſed the Army of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth to Mutiny; So that he was forced to retreat back from <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and go into <hi>Italy</hi> again; For it is the duty of theſe men to be able to make uſe of their Swords, rather then of their Tongues. And what Perſons ſoever are condemned to die, let them ſuffer by the hands of the Army, rather then by the Commanders; leaſt by this meanes He ſhould draw an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium upon himſelf. But yet he ought oftentimes to pardon thoſe that are guilty of death, eſpecially when not a few only, but the whole Army become interceſſors for them: as was the caſe of <hi>Papirius, Torquatus,</hi> and <hi>Druſus,</hi> as it is reported by <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Tacitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spaniards are good Foot Souldiers even in Mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places, or when they are to fight from a wall in defending any ſtrong Hold. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Netherlanders</hi> are good Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and charge Notably well in an open field, and at the firſt Onſet. The <hi>Italians</hi> would do well at both theſe, did not the abuſing of their own proper Inclinations ſpoyl them. All Mountainous People, as the <hi>Biſcaines, Switzers,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> that inhabit the <hi>Appennine;</hi> So likewiſe the <hi>Saxons,</hi> are excellent Foot Souldiers, and are naturally deſirous of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they are alſo accounted very faithful, though not very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Thoſe that inhabit Champian Countries, as the <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſians, Caſtilians, Auſtrians, Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> are excellent Horſemen; and are to be kept in Obedience by a ſtrict hand; but they are each of them both an Unfaithful, and a ſubtile kind of People.</p>
               <p>All theſe conſiderations a General muſt exactly obſerve, if he intends to manage his Army diſcreetly, and according to Art; unleſſe he have the skill of judging of the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Souldiers by Phyſiognomy, as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> had.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:118554:44"/>
               <p>After any of his Souldiers are arrived to the age of fifty yeares, he muſt then encourage them with gifts; that ſo they be may enticed to ſtay the longer in the Service; and when they once come to the age of five and fifty, he muſt either put them into Caſtles, and ſtrong holds, or elſe he muſt diſmiſſe them quite, and let them go to their homes. He muſt accuſtome his Souldiers alſo to carry burthens, or to carry forth the Earth in making Entrenchments, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to do when they wanted men to dig their Trenches. Or let him put them to make Bridges, or to mend the Gallies, as <hi>Caeſars</hi> Army did in the Low-Countries and in England.</p>
               <p>And although the Fortune of the Wars does not alwayes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thoſe that have the greateſt Armies, as may be ſeen in the Example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who with Thirty Thouſand Old Souldiers ſubdued the whole World: and of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> alſo, who with ſmall numbers conquered Multitudes, yet however it is a very good thing to be alwaies provided with good full numbers of Souldiers.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that the <hi>Turk</hi> hath almoſt in all Battels been the Conquerour: for having ſuch a multitude of Souldiers as he hath, and placing all the moſt Inconſiderable of them in the Van, our Souldiers having ſpent themſelves in fighting with, and cutting off theſe, are at length fallen upon by the Janizaries who are freſh, as not having ſtruck a ſtroak before, and ſo are overcome. This Courſe of his, I confeſſe I ſhould like well enough, were it not a wicked and Inhumane one. Therefore ſuch Commanders are to be ſent into the Wars, as are both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Souldiers, and ſuch as will propoſe to themſelves the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and Glory of Chriſtianity only, and not their own glory; Neither ought He upon every ſlight occaſion to expoſe his men to death. And beſides, the General muſt ſometimes, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall require, take care in perſon of his maimed, and ſick Souldiers; that by this means He may the more indear himſelf to them. He is alſo to have Preachers to go along with him in his Army, who are to put him in mind of God, after the Example of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> And if a Commander would conquer his enemy with a ſmall number, it will concern him that he have more of his own Souldiers with him, then either of Auxiliaries, or Hired Souldiers, or of thoſe that are Guarders of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers: leaſt, when they come to the point, they all run away.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118554:44"/>There are many more Obſervations required to the making up of a Perfect Commander; all which I cannot here ſet down; my deſign being at preſent to deliver ſuch things as concern Spain only. But above all care muſt be taken, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers be not uſed like Beaſts; who, if they have but their wages duly paid them; and, if when they are wounded, they be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked to; and be encouraged alſo to ſhew themſelves Valiant men through the hopes of Military glory, and by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Preachers, and by rewards; they will then never think either of running away, or of Revolting; which are two of the greateſt Miſchiefs that can befal an Army.</p>
               <p>I would alſo have ſome perſons appointed, out of ſome of the Religious Orders, to commit to writing the famous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Acts of each particular Souldier; which ſhould be read openly, before the King, when ever He beſtowes rewards upon his Souldiers. For this is the reaſon, why the Barons refuſe to ſerve in perſon in the Wars, ſaying; <hi>The King himſelf is not there, to be an eye witnenſſe of my Valour; and I cannot confide in the treacherous Memories of Envious Commanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither would I have the Souldiers to be rewarded with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny only, but ſometimes alſo with ſome Coronet, either of <hi>Oak.</hi> or of <hi>Olive;</hi> which is a moſt Magnificent argument of Honour to them, and of no charge to the Prince; and by this means they will be the more faithful, and conſtant to Him. For an other mans Mony may in like manner buy and ſell perhaps that Faith, which you have ſo purchaſed of them; but ſuch Honour it cannot: ſeeing it is a moſt ignominious thing, even in the eſteem of an Enemy himſelf, for any one to forſake his King. And therefore it ſhould be lawful for any man to kill ſuch a one, as ſhould begin to run away; or, that goes abroad a pillaging without the leave of his Commander: which very thing hath often hindered the obtaining of Victory againſt the Enemy; and thoſe that are of leaſt account in the Army do by theſe courſes enrich themſelves, while the Valiant Souldier fights it out to the laſt drop of blood in his body. What Souldier ſoever ſhall fill up the place of his ſlain fellow-Souldier, or protects him, and ſaves his life; he ſhould have a <hi>Coronet of Oak</hi> granted him: This was called by the <hi>Romans, Corona Civica.</hi> That Souldier, that ſhall firſt get upon the Enemies Walls, ſhould have a <hi>Mural Coronet,</hi> made of Herbs wreathed together in form of a Coronet;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118554:45"/>which he ſhould recieve at the hands of the General; whiles the reſt of the Army ſtanding round about ſhall celebrate his Gallantry with Acclamations and Songs, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome of the <hi>Romans.</hi> For, theſe two things, <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> are the two Pillars whereon all Military Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is founded and built: the Former whereof deterrs the Souldier from wicked courſes; as the latter pricks him on to do gallant things: the Former was deviſed for the reſtraining of Vile, Rebellious ſpirits; as the latter was for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Generous, and Valiant: the former ſerves inſtead of a <hi>Bridle,</hi> as the later doth of a <hi>Spur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great erected, for the honour of his Souldiers that were Slain at the River <hi>Granicus,</hi> Statues of Marble, in a moſt ſtately manner. The King of <hi>Siam,</hi> that he might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his Souldiers to fight bravely, took care to have the names of all thoſe that had behaved themſelves Gallantly in the Wars, to be regiſtred in a Book, and afterwards to be recited before him: which was the cuſtome alſo of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture teſtifieth.</p>
               <p>Whenſoever there are any deſigns on foot for the gaining any large Kingdom, or Empire; the King ought alwayes to go in perſon to the Wars; becauſe that Princes that are Warlick, alwaies get more then thoſe that are [ſluggiſh and negligent: which is a conſideration of great importance for all ſuch Princes, as deſire to enlarge their Dominions. But if they care only to preſerve their own, they may then ſtay at home themſelves; provided that they ſet Valiant, and faithful Commanders over their Souldiers. However, it will concern a Prince that he get an opinion of being a Warlike man, unleſſe he mean to be deſpiſed by all People; or let him make an open ſhew that he loves Wars. And to the end that He may be the more ſecure of Victory, let him alwaies take with him good ſtore of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; that ſo he may neither loſe his reputation, nor be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Defeats of his Armies are the leaſt hurtful to Him, where He himſelf was not preſent at the Engagement. Strength of his forces at Sea, wherein the <hi>Genoeſe, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> do moſt excel, is alſo a moſt neceſſary buſineſſe. For, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall make himſelf maſter of the Seas, the ſame ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all by Land alſo.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the Treaſury of</hi> Spain.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is neceſſary that the King have a full Treaſury, if it be but for the keeping up of his Reputation abroad: for, as the World goes now a dayes, the Power of Princes is valued according to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Purſes, rather then the largeneſſe of their Territories. And therefore not only in the time of War, but of peace alſo, it behoves a Prince to have alwaies good ſtore of ready Mony by him: For it is a very hard, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous buſineſſe alſo, eſpecially when He is now already engaged in a War, to expect, and wait till monies can be raiſed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tolle moras: Semper nocuit differre paratis.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>It is neceſſary therefore, that there be Monies alwayes in a readineſſe for the raiſing of Souldiers in an inſtant: leaſt while you are employed in getting Mony together, your Enemy be before hand with you. To this end <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> erected a Military Treaſury, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> teſtifieth; and that he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and without any trouble be provided of Mony for the raiſing, and paying of his Souldiers, he filled the ſame with New Taxes, and Impoſitions. And certainly very many wonder how it comes to paſſe, that the King of Spain, whoſe yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues amount to above twenty Millions, hath not by this time made Himſelf Univerſal Monarch of all Chriſtendome, nor hath all this while ſo much as as once ſet upon the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom I anſwer, that this is nothing at all to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, if they would but take notice, that the reaſon of this it, becauſe He hath not the skill to lay hold on <hi>Occaſion,</hi> when it is offered Him; which very thing hath hitherto upheld the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of all Great Empires, For there was an Occaſion given him at the Uniting of the Kingdomes of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> and of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Millan:</hi> but there was a much fairer offered to <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who was a man of a Warlike ſpirit; &amp; being King of Spain, was afterwards choſen alſo Emperour of <hi>Germany;</hi> by al which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages He might have been able to have made himſelf Lord of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118554:46"/>the whole Earth, had He but known as well how to give Lawes to thoſe He conquered, as He knew how to conquer them. This Prince took <hi>Tunis,</hi> and having driven thence <hi>Ariodenus</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> He made <hi>Muleaſſes</hi> King of that place, without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former State of the Kingdom at all. After this He conquered <hi>Germany;</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> there: whom He deveſted of their Electoral Dignity, ſubſtituting into their places their Brethren, and Kinſmen: but otherwiſe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in the ſame ſtate He found them. And although He had once got <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf into his hands and power; yet, looking after the empty Fame only of being accounted a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſul Prince, He let him go again; that ſo he might have the opportunity (forſooth) of reducing all <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</hi> He took <hi>Francis,</hi> the King of <hi>France;</hi> and then ſet him again at liberty; that ſo he might raiſe up a new War againſt Him, and thereby fruſtrate all that He had done before. He alſo took in the Cities of <hi>Sienna, Florence;</hi> and beſtowed them upon the Family of the <hi>Medici;</hi> that ſo He might procure himſelf more powerful enemies by the bargain. For, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is raiſed by any one to ſome degree of Power, what ſervice ſoever is due from him to his Rayſer, he will be ſure to decline the doing it as much as he can: and therefore he ſeeks all the occaſions he can of ſhaking off the Yoak, that he may make his Benefactor, his Enemy: which very thing was done by the Dukes of <hi>Florence,</hi> and by <hi>Maurice,</hi> Prince Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               <p>And indeed ſuch Benefits as, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of them, cannot any way be returned; commonly they draw a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Virtue of the Benefactor: as we ſee it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell out in the caſe betwixt the aforementioned <hi>Francis,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe that this Monarchy hath not yet hitherto been brought about, is this, becauſe that <hi>Philip</hi> could not ſucceed his Father, not ſo much as in the War, and therefore loſt both the <hi>Low. Countries,</hi> together with the Imperial Titles. But that Affliction which alſo fell upon him by the loſſe of <hi>Charles,</hi> his Son, was the moſt grievous of all the reſt: for he would have been able to have maintained the Wars in His ſtead: which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King of Spain is not able to do, He is conſtrained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to defend, and make good the bounds of his Kingdom
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118554:46"/>rather, then to endeavour to enlarge them; and to look to his Commanders, and ſee that they do not pillage the Countries where their Command lies, and enrich themſelves out of the Kings Treaſure; it being their onely care, how to keep up ſuch a Trade of War, by which they may make advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather then any way enlarge the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore here lay down theſe Rules, (though they are not ſo proper for this place) that when any new Country is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, that is of a different Religion, and manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Natives are preſently to be removed out of it and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into ſome other Country, where they may ſerve as Slaves; and their Children are to be Baptized, and may be either put into the <hi>Seminaries</hi> before ſpoken of, or elſe ſent into the <hi>New World;</hi> and into this conquered Country may be ſent Colonies of Spaniards, under the conduct of ſome Wiſe and faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Which Courſe ought to have been taken by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth at <hi>Tunis;</hi> who ſhould alſo have carried away <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſſes</hi> to <hi>Naples.</hi> And He ſhould by right have done the very ſame thing in <hi>Germany;</hi> namely, in <hi>Saxony,</hi> in the Marquiſat of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and the Lantgravedome of <hi>Heſſen:</hi> into which Countries He ſhould have ſent New Colonies, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of New Governours.</p>
               <p>The Free Cities alſo He ſhould have ſuppreſſed and have taken away their Priviledges: and laſtly, He ſhould have made Three Cardinals the Governous of all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when any New Country is taken in, that is not of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religion, but only differing in Government, let Him then change nothing at all, in matters that concern the People: but only let Him ſet ſtrong Guards upon the Country; and let the Chief Officers be choſen all out of the Kings party, but the Inferiour out of the Common People of the place: the Lawes whereof may alſo be altered by little and little, and made to conforme to the Kings Lawes, either by heightning, or abating the rigour of them, according as the Condition and Temper of the place ſhall require. All Authors, or Heads of <hi>Factoins</hi> muſt be preſently removed out of the way, either by Death, if they have been Enemies; or, if they have been friends, they muſt be carried away into Spain, that they may there receive
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118554:47"/>Baronies for their reward, or may have liberty of free Traffick into the Kings Dominions granted them. But the Chief Heads of ſuch People as He ſhall ſubdue, He muſt never ſuffer to continue in their places; which courſe ought to have been taken with the <hi>Strozzi, Medici, Cappones, Petruccij,</hi> and other Ringleaders and Heads of Factions, at <hi>Sienna,</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed the ſame Courſe ſhould have been taken with <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> that ſo he might have had no further opportunity of attempting any thing againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the V. But as for the Hereticks, and <hi>Luther,</hi> the beſt way would have been to have ſuppreſſed them, under ſome other Pretenſe, preſently after the breaking up of the Diet at <hi>Auſburg;</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had but taken theſe Courſes, He had never left behind him ſo much work and trouble for King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip;</hi> and perhaps his young ſon <hi>Charles</hi> too might have been alive at this day; and might perhaps by His Arms have added <hi>Africk, Hungary, Macedonia, Italy,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. But He, as I have before ſaid, was the onely cauſe of all thoſe Evills, which we ſee at this day. So that I do not wonder at all, that notwithſtanding the vaſt Treaſures of the King of Spain, yet the bounds of His Monarchy are not all this while enlarged. But I rather wonder, that ſo Wealthy a Prince hath not laid up all ſuch his Revenues, for Neceſſary Uſes againſt times of need; which might have been his ruin. For if ſo be his Negotiation by Sea ſhould be ſtopt, or interrupted but for one five, or ſix yeares ſpace together, or that his Plate Fleet ſhould be intercepted in its return home from the Weſt-Indies, would it not be ſo fore a cut to him, as that he muſt of neceſſity be forced to oppreſſe his own ſnbjects by laying moſt heavy and unuſual Taxes upon them, and ſo draw upon himſelf their Hate? and beſides, ſhould he not alſo undoe all his Merchants, and defraud his Souldiers of their Pay, and by that means be in danger of loſing them upon every the leaſt Occaſion? And indeed it is a thing much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, how, and which way ſuch vaſt Summes of Mony ſhould come to be waſted, and yet the King not any thing at all the better for it; for we ſee, that He is ſtill Poor for all this, and is almoſt continually borrowing Mony of others. And therefore I ſay, that it is Impoſſible but that things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118554:47"/>ſhould alwayes ſucceed ill with Him, ſo long as there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for the remedying of this miſchief.</p>
               <p>Yet I do not ſay, that a Kings whole ſtrengh conſiſts only in his Mony; but He is to conſider, that Mony alone will do little toward the ſubduing of an Enemy. And indeed we read that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> by his great knowledge in Military affaires, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving withal the love of his Souldiers, though they were but a very Small Army, to ſpeake of, yet for all this conquered the whole World. And ſo likewiſe the <hi>Saracens, Tartarians,</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> without any Mony, made themſelves Lords of almoſt the whole World. We confeſſe therefore, that Mony is of Excellent good uſe, and moſt neceſſary for a Prince, for the Preſerving and making good the Bounds of his Dominions; but not at all for the enlarging of them, by adding New Provinces to the ſame. And therefore let him believe, that the ſinews of his Strength lye in ſomething elſe then his Mony. For, that Faith that is purchaſed by Mony, may again be ſold for Mony. And therefore I beſeech you, do but obſerve, how in <hi>France</hi> our King <hi>Philip</hi> by his mony procured the Dukes of <hi>Maine, Joyeuſe, Mercoeur,</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to take up Armes againſt the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and then again, how the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> by the ſame meanes got over the very ſame men to His ſide, after they found King <hi>Philip</hi> to be grown ſomewhat cloſe-fiſted, and not to come off with his Mony ſo freely as before. And in like manner the Commanders, and Souldiers in the Low-Countries do now a daies rather exerciſe the profeſſion of <hi>Hucksters,</hi> then of Souldiers: for, they do not fight, that they may overcome their Enemy; but that they may make a gain of their ſerving in the Wars; And ſo have made Armes, which are the Inſtruments of Monarchy, to be the Inſtruments of their Covetouſneſſe, and their Sports. And the King deceives himſelf, whiles He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues all Covetous Deſigns; for, He hath Mony enough, if he have but Souldiers enough; and if there be withal but Mutual love betwixt him and them, and a due regard had to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral merits; which things if they be wanting, he ſhall be ſure to be a ſufficient Loſer in the end.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, and above all things, let the King endeavour to treaſure up to himſelf the Minds and Affections of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Vaſſals, and indear himſelf to them, by his own Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry both in Peace, and in War; making Himſelf admired by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118554:48"/>them, by making profeſſion of, and propoſing to them ſome New Sciences, &amp;c. as hath been ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let Him raiſe himſelf a Treaſure of his Subjects <hi>Bodies,</hi> by cauſing them to multiply by Frequency of <hi>Marriages;</hi> to which they are to be encouraged by Honours, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, &amp;c. as was alſo touched before.</p>
               <p>And in the Third place, let Him raiſe himſelf a Treaſure out of the Wealth of his Subjects, whiles He makes them Rich, by taking care that <hi>Agriculture,</hi> and Manuring of the Ground be promoted; and that the making of Silks, Woollen Cloath, and the like Uſeful and Profitable Arts, and Trades be ſet on foot, and diligently followed; rather, then that ſuch Courſes ſhould be taken, as we ſee now adaies every where; whiles in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Towns, moſt people give themſelves to Uſury; and in the Greater Cities men for the moſt part apply themſelves to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and Extorſion. The <hi>Pope</hi> raiſes up his Treaſures in the Minds of Men; and therefore is He a Conquerour; becauſe that This, being conjoyned with Eloquence and Wiſedom, is the onely Inſtrument by which that Treaſure is acquired. And hence it was, that the <hi>Saracens,</hi> by the uſe of their <hi>Tongue,</hi> and alſo by making Profeſſion of New Sciences, and of a <hi>New Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> became Conquerours. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> raiſed Himſelf a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both in Minds and Bodies; by His own Perſonal Virtue and Gallantry, winning to himſelf, and obliging the Hearts, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Whole Souldiery. But the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and <hi>Hunnes</hi> did this by Bodies only; rendring them ſo Fruitful, as that by reaſon of their Vaſt numbers, they were fain to leave their Native ſoyl, marching out of it in huge bodies, (like ſwarms of Bees) and ſeizing upon others Territories. But now the King may, by His Own juſt Right, exact all theſe Treaſures at the hands of his Subjects; as namely, <hi>Religion,</hi> by placing Able Preachers among them; <hi>Love,</hi> by Good Lawes, the Subjects Profit, and True Juſtice; and Multiplication of them, by the Waies before laid down, where I ſpoke touching the encreaſing of the Number of the Souldiery: and let Him require of each ſeveral Nation, that, which they moſt abound in; as, <hi>People,</hi> from the <hi>Germans; Souldiers,</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards; Commanders</hi> in War, and <hi>Garments,</hi> from the <hi>Italians;</hi> from the <hi>Weſt-Indies, Gold;</hi> but not the contrary.</p>
               <p>We may truly affirm, that the <hi>New World</hi> hath in a manner
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118554:48"/>undone the <hi>Old;</hi> for it hath ſowen Covetouſneſſe in our Minds, and hath quite extinguiſhed Mutual Love among men. For, all the World are wretchedly in love with <hi>Gold</hi> only: and hence it is, that Men are become Deceitful, and Fraudulent in their dealings, and have often ſold, and re-ſold their Faith for Hire; becauſe they ſaw that <hi>Mony</hi> was That, that did the buſineſſe every where, and that was held in Admiration by all people; and ſo They are come now to deſpiſe all Sciences, and Holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in compariſon of Mony; and have bid Adieu both to Agriculture, and other Arts, applying themſelves only to look after the Fertility and Increaſe of <hi>Mony,</hi> and to get themſelves into Rich Mens houſes. It hath likewiſe Introduced a great Diſparity amongſt Men, making them either too Rich, whence they become Proud, and Inſolent; or elſe, leaving them too Poor, whence proceeds Envy, Theft, and Open Robbery. Hence alſo it is, that the prices of Corn, Wine, Fleſh, Oyl, and Cloath, are very much raiſed; becauſe that no man applies himſelf to this kind of Merchandiſe; whence followes Want, and Penury; and yet Monies in the mean while muſt be laid out: In ſo much, that the poorer ſort, being not able to hold out in the world, are fain either to put themſelves into ſervice; or elſe betake themſelves to robbing upon the High-Way, or elſe turn Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being neceſſitated to do ſo through Poverty, and not at all for Love either of the King, or of Religion; and many times alſo they run away from their Colours, or elſe change them: neither do they endeavour to get Children in a Lawful Way of Marriage, becauſe they are not able to pay Taxes: or elſe perhaps they try all the waies that poſſibly they can, to get to be admitted into ſome Covent or other for Friers, or Preachers. I therefore here leave it to the King to conſider, whether or no He may not rather be overcome by <hi>Gold,</hi> which is the Cauſe of ſo many Evils.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that there are many things here that ſtand in need of a Reformation, that ſo the Kings Treaſury may grow Rich, and that He himſelf may have greater Teſtimonies of his Subjects Love, and Fidelity: which might eaſily be brought about, if ſo be that thoſe Rules before laid down, touching the encreaſing the Number of the Subjects, and the remitting and abating the Taxes and Exactions laid upon them, were but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: and if the King, going into the Wars Himſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118554:49"/>would by that means chalk out, to his Wiſe and Valiant Commanders, and Souldiers, the Way to Honour, rather then to Covetouſneſſe; and would alſo propoſe New Arts, and Sciences. So likewiſe if He would make ſome ſuch Lawes, to which thoſe that are <hi>Obedient,</hi> ſhould have their former honours continued to them; but the Refractory, and <hi>Diſobedient</hi> ſhould have Diſgraces caſt upon them: and to perſwade Obedience to which Lawes, there ſhould in the Second place, ſome <hi>Profit,</hi> and Advantage be propoſed for ſuch: but, in the Third place, before the Diſobedient ſhould be laid down the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> to which our Modern Writers abſurdly attribute the Firſt Place, in Relation to the due Obſerving of Lawes; who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Time</hi> rather, then to <hi>Religion,</hi> require <hi>Fear</hi> in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, rather then <hi>Love:</hi> becauſe that the Rulers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> preferred this Later, before the Former; and ſo taught that Wicked Wretch, <hi>Macchiavel,</hi> and other the like Polititians, thoſe Rules.</p>
               <p>But if there be no place left for a Reformation, it is then neceſſary, that, reſpect being had to the Preſent Abuſes, there ſhould be good ſtore of Treaſure got up together; leſt at length the King ſhould be undone by Uſe-Mony, or ſome other Loſſes ſhould fall upon him; in caſe the Plate Fleet ſhould not return back from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> in three or four years together per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps. I ſhall firſt therefore lay down the Uſual Rules, in this caſe; and then, ſuch other as I my ſelf have thought upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, there muſt be matter adminiſtred for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers;</hi> and every one of them is to be bound, under a certain Penalty, to have alwaies a ſtock of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies lying by them; that ſo, when there ſhall be any Neceſſity, the King may know where to fetch preſently good ſtore of Large Summes of Mony: Which Courſe is to be taken in all the chief Cities, both in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and of <hi>Spain.</hi> Then, when any great War is near at hand, the ſaid Summes of Mony are to be called for at the ſaid Uſurers hands; and that, by the intervening too of the Popes Authority, that ſo the King may not draw upon himſelf alone the Hatred, and Ill Will of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him introduce the <hi>Tribute</hi> of <hi>Apulia,</hi> (which was brought up by King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>) through all the Provinces
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118554:49"/>that are under him, impoſing it either in the ſame, or ſome other the like Form.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let Him cauſe all the <hi>Barons</hi> to bring in what ſummes of Mony they have, binding them thereto in the name of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which they are joyned, and engaged.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let Him procure of the Pope <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſados</hi> for all his Kingdomes; and thoſe Summes of Mony, that ſhall be raiſed by the ſame, He ſhall lay up in ſome Treaſury, where they may encreaſe to ſuch a quantity, as that an Army may be raiſed out of them, which may be ſent into the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, let Him get an Injunction from the Pope, that, for the ſpace of five years, all Churches, Monaſteries, Biſhopricks, and Pariſhes throughout all his Provinces, ſhall pay in a certain ſum of Mony into <hi>The Sacred Treaſury,</hi> ſo called, as being collected for the making of a War againſt the Infidels; that is to ſay, <hi>Five</hi> in the <hi>Hundred,</hi> of all their Revenues; but ſo, that every year there ſhould be an abatement made of <hi>One:</hi> As namely, the firſt year they ſhould pay <hi>Five</hi> in the Hundred, the ſecond year <hi>Four,</hi> the third <hi>Three,</hi> and ſo on, till the five years be expired. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> exact the Tenths. And this Courſe may be taken, betwixt the King and the Pope, under the Pretenſe of making a War upon the Infidels. After all this is done, let Him then appoint two Biſhops to be the Treaſurers of this Mony.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, let the King, by his Treaſurers, traffick in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with ſuch Commodities as are uſed there; as in <hi>Calabria,</hi> with Silks; in <hi>Apulia,</hi> with Wheat; in <hi>Sicily,</hi> with Oyl; for by this means He will divert his Subjects from applying themſelves to Uſury, and will cauſe them to attend more the Manuring of the Ground, and withal will hereby mightily enrich Himſelf.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, let Him ſend out into every City, and Town, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> a Commiſſary, having a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour joyned with him, who ſhall be one of the Clergy, to make enquiry into all Uſurers; and to cauſe Them to make it appear by the teſtimony of Three Witneſſes, that they have taken no other Uſe, then what is allowed to be taken by the cuſtome of the Kingdom: and where they ſhall find any to have done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to ſeize upon all they are worth, and carry it away to ſome publick place for the King's uſe.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:118554:50"/>
               <p>But then, the King may afterwards reſtore half of it to them again, if he think fit: as for example; ſuppoſe his Officers took away from any of theſe Uſurers Ten Thouſand Crownes; He may then reſtore to the Owner Five Thouſand Crownes of his Mony again. For they are a hateful ſort of People, and are deſpiſed by all men; ſo that you need never fear that they will rebel: and beſides, the people, when ever they ſee Them ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be very glad of it, neither will any of them take their parts; and indeed the Uſurers themſelves, when they have half of their eſtates left them, will think themſelves very well dealt withal. And with the reſt of ſuch Monies the King may ſet up <hi>A Bank of Charity,</hi> where poor people ſhall take up Monies upon their <hi>Pawn;</hi> but upon this condition, that if they redeem not their Pawn by the Limited Time, that then it ſhall be forfeit to the King. And afterward with the Mony ariſing from hence, He may drive a Trade of Merchandiſe, as the Uſurers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uſe to do: or elſe He may with thoſe monies erect <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> or <hi>Seminaries</hi> for Souldiers, and Poor Women, as hath been ſhewed before. And if ſome of the Clergy were ſent abroad with the like Commiſſions to inquire into the Barons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it would do them much good, both in reference to their Soul, Body, and State; who otherwiſe by their arts would ſwallow up, and devour the whole World.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, let Him require an Account of all the Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Commiſſioners, for the whole time of their being employed in their Offices: and whatſoever Fines ſhall be ſet upon their heads, let it be put into the Treaſury; or the King may remit half to them, if he pleaſe; or leſſe, as he ſhall ſee cauſe: and by taking this courſe with them, both Himſelf and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall be much advantaged, and have cauſe to rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, let Him call all thoſe before Him, that have been condemned by any Sentence of Judgment, or have any waies been branded with any Note of Infamy; and let Him command all ſuch Judgments paſſed againſt them, within the ſpace of five years paſt, to be burnt: by which Act of His, the Offenders will reckon themſelves highly honoured; but yet, for this favour of the Kings, they ſhall be bound to pay down ſuch a certain Summe of Mony.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, let every one that enters firſt into any great City, ſuch as <hi>Naples</hi> is, or into any Garriſon, ſuch as is that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118554:50"/>of <hi>Cotron,</hi> pay ſomething at his entrance, under pretenſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of all that enter in. Then, let there be an Impoſition laid upon all things whatſoever, that are uſed both for Neceſſity and Superfluity; but upon things of Neceſſary uſe, as Meat, Drink, Oyl, and the like, the Impoſition ſhould not be great; but upon things of ſuperfluity, it ſhould be higher. As, upon Cards, let there be put an Impoſition of two Carolines; and upon Dice, one Caroline; upon every <hi>Quire</hi> of <hi>Writing Paper,</hi> one <hi>Grain;</hi> upon every pair of <hi>Gloves,</hi> half a Caroline: but upon <hi>Silks,</hi> and Garments richly wrought with Needlework, and Embroideries of Silver and Gold, there muſt be higher Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid, for the benefit of the King. But I would have the greateſt Impoſitions to be laid upon <hi>Whores;</hi> as at <hi>Naples,</hi> and in all other places, the Taxe ſhould be encreaſed half a <hi>Ducat</hi> upon every Bawdy-houſe. Neither ſhould Baths, or Play-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Players be exempted from theſe Impoſitions; nor yet Innes, Taverns, or any Houſes of Publick entertainment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And in all things let the Rule before laid down be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; namely, that <hi>Neceſſary</hi> things ſhould have but a ſmall Impoſition put upon them; but a Greater, upon thoſe that are <hi>not neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe the King, when He is preſſed by any great Neceſſity of the State, may have an Eſtimate made of all his Subjects Lands, and accordingly impoſe Taxes and Tributes upon the ſame. And that this ſhould be done, is both Right and Juſt: for, every <hi>Private Good</hi> ought to ſerve the <hi>Publique Good;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, mens Private Eſtates could not be upheld, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. But I would have theſe to be, not <hi>Perſonal,</hi> but <hi>Real Taxes;</hi> that is, they ſhould not be levied upon the Perſons, by the Pole, but upon their Eſtates: leſt otherwiſe the whole burthen of theſe Taxes ſhouldly upon the ſhoulders of the Poor only, as it uſes to do for the moſt part. For the Gentry uſe to ſhake off the burthen that is impoſed upon them, and caſt it upon the Commons; as, in like manner, the Principal Cities caſt off theirs upon the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: which is againſt all Juſtice and Equity in the World. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any Goods to be Taxed but only ſuch as are Certain, and Immoveable; for, the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> going about to lay a Taxe upon all Goods indifferently, as well Moveable, and Uncertain, as others, cauſed the whole Country of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to riſe up againſt him. And if at any time, when the Urgent
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118554:51"/>Neceſſities of the Kingdome ſhall ſo require, you will lay a Taxe upon Moveable, and Uncertain Goods alſo; I ſhould like it well enough, if there were the ſame courſe taken in proceeding herein, as they uſe to take in ſome certain Cities of <hi>Germany;</hi> as namely, <hi>Norimberg, Auſpurg, Collen,</hi> and ſome others; where they uſe to put every man to his Oath. Yet that way of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Taxes is the more Juſt, and Legal, that put them upon all manner of Merchandiſe, and Commodities, that are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported abroad, or imported into any of the Kings Dominions; for it is but Juſt, and Reaſonable, that whoſoever makes any gain to himſelf in Our Country, or by our Commodities, he ſhould pay ſomething in Conſideration thereof.</p>
               <p>And whereas all Such Merchants are either the Kings Subjects, or elſe are Forraigners; it is fit that we ſhould exact greater <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> from Forraigners, then from our Own Merchants: which Rule the Great <hi>Turk</hi> obſerves at this day; exacting Ten in the Hundred upon all Commodities that are imported from <hi>Alexandria</hi> by Forraigners; but taking but Five in the Hundred of his own Merchants. In <hi>England</hi> all Forrain Merchants pay four times as much in <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> as the Natives do; but in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> they pay but three times; and ſo their payments are diverſe, according to the diverſity of Places.</p>
               <p>To ſumme up all in a Word; Whereſoever all thoſe things that are Neceſſary for the Subſtentation of Mans Life, are found in greateſt Abundance and Plenty, to that place will there ever be a Conflux of Riches: ſo that it will concern every Prince to uſe his Utmoſt endeavours in bringing his Subjects to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Husbandry, and the following all ſorts of Arts and Manufactures: of which we have ſpoken elſewhere more at large. Then, I would have all thoſe Waies of raiſing of Mony, that are hateful to the People, either to be quite taken away, or elſe to have ſome other name put upon them: in like manner as the Taxes alſo, and Impoſitions paid into the Exchequer ought to be ſomewhat abated, and to be exacted of the Subject under ſome other Name. And hence it was, that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> did not ſtile Himſelf, King, but onely, <hi>Tribune;</hi> becauſe that the Name of a <hi>King</hi> was hateful to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And therefore I would have the name of <hi>Tribute,</hi> to be changed to <hi>Erogations,</hi> or <hi>Contribution:</hi> and theſe Names alſo I would have to be altered perpetually. And becauſe the Name of <hi>Donative</hi> is now become
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118554:51"/>hateful, and loathſome to the People, the King may do well to lay aſide that Name, and put ſome Other upon it. But I ſhall not diſcourſe ſo very Particularly, and Punctually of theſe things here, as I could.</p>
               <p>The Kings Trafficking with the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> is as good as a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to Him: let Him therefore uſe all the means He can, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure liberty of exerciſing the like Traffick and Commerce with other Nations and Countries. There are alſo many other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Profits which Princes may raiſe to themſelves, partly from their Own Subjects, and partly alſo from Forraigners: ſuch as are <hi>Caſualties, Confiſcations, Eſcheats, Donatives, Portions, Honoraries,</hi> as they call them, and many other the like; of all which I ſhould ſpeak particularly: But I have reſolved to keep this diſcourſe, till I ſhall have an opportunity of ſpeaking thereof in the preſence of his Majeſtie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the</hi> Peoples Love, <hi>and</hi> Hate: <hi>and alſo of</hi> Conſpiracies.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may perhaps be thought fit by ſome, that in Common-Wealths, Mutual Love ſhould be maintained amongſt all Fellow-Citizens, for the benefit of the Publick; as we ſee it is among the <hi>Venetians:</hi> But that in all <hi>Monarchical</hi> Governments, Hatred, and Diſſentions are to be ſowen abroad among the Subjects; leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when any of them were injured by the Prince, the reſt ſhould joyn in revenging their fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wrong upon the Prince; or leſt they ſhould at any time all Unanimouſly conſpire againſt Him: and ſo all the Subjects Love ſhould be joyntly bent againſt the King. But this Rule is moſt Abſurd, ſeveral waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it makes the King to be a moſt cruel Tyrant, who takes care of Himſelf alone, and not of his Subjects in General: and ſo by this means, through the mutual Hatred of his Subjects, the King doth not at all procure their Love, but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118554:52"/>rather kindles their Envy againſt himſelf, and ſo lives in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe all Natural Dominion requires Concord amongſt the People, that ſo they may be able more ſtoutly, and effectually to reſiſt all Enemies whatſoever; and may oblige one another by Mutual Offices, both at home, and in War. And therefore all good Lawgivers have uſed their utmoſt Endeavors, to procure a Union, and, as it were, a knitting together of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by the Bonds of Mutual Love, and of Unity in Religion: and therefore they have provided, that they ſhould All meet together in Churches, to the end that they might the better know the reaſon why they ought to love one another: For, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido:</hi> No man deſires, what He knowes not. And upon this Conſideration it was, that <hi>Plato</hi> forbad all <hi>Private Chappels:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo gave order, that there ſhould be erected but One Temple only, in the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Jews;</hi> that ſo, all of them concurring, and agreeing together in One Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in the Love of One Only God, might every way fill up one compleat Mutual Love amongſt themſelves. And to this end, beſides Marriages, were <hi>Clienteles,</hi> or Multitudes of Clients, and Followers deſigned; and diverſe other Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tending to the promoting, and advancing of Mutual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and Advantage.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe Companies of Merchants; and Officious Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to great Perſons, taken up upon deſigne of doing them Service, or Honour. And all theſe things are profitable to the Prince; But ſo is not the Hatred of his People; for this proved very Prejudicial to <hi>France.</hi> And ſuch Conteſts betwixt the Prince and his Subjects have made for the Advantage of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> when ever the People got the better of it: Although the Contrary happened in <hi>Florence.</hi> For there, the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Plebeians</hi> did not raiſe themſelves to the Condition of Gentlemen; but, on the contrary the Gentry debaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down to the ſtate of <hi>Plebeians;</hi> the Contrary whereof happened at <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore my Advice is, that the Prince ſhould uſe his utmoſt endeavour to procure, that there be a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love and Correſpondence among his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Now this Mutual Love is maintained, Firſt, by their Unity in Religion; and by rooting out all thoſe that endeavour to ſow Tares abroad; which was the Loſſe of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:118554:52"/>Secondly, by Spaniards marrying with any other Nations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; Thirdly, by having Commerce and Traffick with Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations; Fourthy, by Introducing an equality amongſt them; for this is an Error, which hath now ſpread it ſelf over all the Chriſtian World, that One man ſhould be very Poor, and another very Rich; which was a thing that <hi>Plato</hi> hated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Whereas a Parity, or Equality between Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is a meanes of removing all Envy, Rapine, Pride, Hatred, and Effeminateneſſe from among them. And hence it was, that <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that every Seventh Year, all Families ſhould have their Inheritances reſtored unto them again; and all Servants, that were of their own Nation, ſhould be ſet at liberty, and have alſo ſome thing given them by their Patrons, at their going off; withall informing them, that this was agreeable to the Law, and will of God. And for this reaſon alſo <hi>Almeſ-houſes, Hoſpitals,</hi> and other the like Places for Charitable uſes were erected; that ſo Honour might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt them with ſome Equality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saluſt</hi> teſtifieth, that there were never any Conſpiracies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by any of the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt their Country, till ſuch time as a Few perſons had gotten into their hands the Wealth of Many; that is to ſay, ſuch as <hi>Craſſus, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And in <hi>Luthers,</hi> and <hi>Calvin's</hi> time, the Country Peaſants in <hi>Germany</hi> roſe up in Armes againſt the Nobility and Gentry, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe thoſe Two having trampled under foot the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Truth, had Sowen Tares, and the Seeds of Sedition, and Subverſion of States every where; to the ruine of whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>And even in our daies alſo we ſee that you ſhall have one Man that hath a hundred Thouſand Crowns a year; and a Thouſand other men again that have hardly each of them a Hundred Crowns a year a piece. And all that Wealth will He ſpend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dogs, Horſes, Jeſters, and in Gold Trappings for his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or elſe upon Whores, which is worſe. And if at any time a Poor man ſhall be put to go to Law with him for any thing, he is ſo far from being able to proſecute his Action againſt Him, as that he is rather fain to get out of the way as faſt as he can, or elſe he may chance to be forced to end his dayes in Priſon: Mean while that the Rich man does every where what he liſts, without controule; becauſe, forſooth, He hath Mony to corrupt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118554:53"/>the Judges with. And indeed, our Judges, for the moſt part, are ſuch as have been made Judges either for Favour, or for Mony; as we ſee it commonly fals out in all Smaller Cities: which certainly is a moſt Pernicious thing to all Principalities. For, it is almoſt an Impoſſible thing, that a Judge that will take a Bribe, ſhould ever diſcharge his Office honeſtly: For, as God himſelf teſtifieth, <hi>A Gift blindeth the Wiſe.</hi> Which, it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will be the practiſe of him that buyeth his Office with Mony; and ſo entreth into it, not as into a Field overrun with Thorns and Briers, but rather as into a moſt plentiful and rich Harveſt. And therefore I ſhall here take the liberty (though it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſide my preſent purpoſe) to admoniſh all Polititians whatſoever, that they ſhould take this for a certain Rule; that <hi>Whoſoever ſells his Offices for Mony, the ſame deſires that his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be Theeves. Lewis</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>France</hi> was wont to ſay, that thoſe that buy Offices, were like Merchants; who buy Goods altogether at any eaſie rate; and afterwards ſell them off in parcels at a dear rate. But to returne to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Although our Rich Man is very liberal, and is at great coſt and charges in the maintaining, and richly cloathing of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Retainers; Yet is not the Common-wealth any thing at all the better for this, but rather ſuffers by it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, becauſe by this means He obligeth them to Himſelf onely, and makes them ſo much his own, as that they will be ready to follow Him againſt any perſon whatſoever, even the King himſelf: which thing was attempted heretofore by that <hi>Roman, Spurius Melius,</hi> againſt his Country: and therefore the <hi>Venetians,</hi> fearing this very thing, ſuffer not any to keep about them any great Retinue. Then beſides, it renders them ſoft, and Effeminate; and makes them to be Flatterers, and Proud Pimps, and Bawds to their Patrons Luſt: and ſo by this means here is erected, as it were, a Seminary of moſt Idle and Vile perſons; who after they have once gotten themſelves Wives, do then by their crafty Wiles oppreſſe poor men, and begin to ſpread abroad the Poyſon of their Wickedneſſe far and near. And for this reaſon it was, that Biſhops have oftentimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden thoſe Prelats that have been under their Juriſdiction, the uſe of a Numerous Retinue; though here, there was no great need of any ſuch Interdiction. For although that ſuch
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118554:53"/>Servants of Prelates are not in truth Honeſt, and Good men; yet are they forced at leaſt to appear ſuch in thoſe places; and ſo they give the leſſe Scandal to the World. Wherefore the King ought to endeavour to introduce an Equality by reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Numerous Retinues.</p>
               <p>Let Him moreover indulge the Common People ſo much, as that for the ſpace of whole ten years, they ſhall pay onely the one half of their Taxes; and for the other half, let Him exact the payment of it at the hands of the Barons, and others that are <hi>Artificers.</hi> I would alſo have thoſe Lawes, and Arts, ſpoken of before, where I treated of the Barons, and Uſurers, to be brought into uſe.</p>
               <p>But for as much as the Spaniards are hated by all Nations, the beſt Courſe would be, that the King ſhould endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to the Spaniard by intermarrying with them; and alſo by erecting ſuch <hi>Military Seminaries,</hi> into which ſhould be admitted indifferently, and be there maintained, Souldiers of all other Nations. For by this means the King ſhall have both a more Copious, and alſo a better Tempered, and more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army: as we ſee <hi>Cheſtnut Graffet,</hi> when they are ſet upon other ſtocks, bring forth the better fruit.</p>
               <p>And this very courſe God himſelf is wont to take; who, that He may render all Mankind the more Noble, uſes to tranſplant the People of the Northern Parts, and to remove them into the more Southern: which He alſo does for ſome other cauſes; which yet are all, ſave one or two, unknown to us. After this let the King of Spain ſo order his affairs, as that not only his ſubjects may live together in mutual love amongſt themſelves, but alſo that He himſelf may be beloved by them: which thing he may eaſily effect, by Enacting Profitable Lawes, by encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the number of his ſubjects, by remitting their Taxes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; by bringing in an Equality amongſt them; and laſtly, by not omitting even thoſe things alſo, of which We ſpoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that nothing is ſo deſtructive to a Prince, as the ſtirring up of the ſubjects Hate againſt Himſelf: whence it is, for the moſt part, that Conſpiracies, and Treaſons are plotted againſt both Prince, and State; it would be very well, if all the ſubjects were of the ſame Religion that the Prince is of: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World doth more ſet men at Variance, then Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118554:54"/>of Religion. And this, the King of <hi>France</hi> hath found to be true, by his own ſad Experience. But it is here neceſſary, that the Prince ſhould ſhun thoſe two Extreams, to wit, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> nud <hi>Superſtition.</hi> God is Truth, and will be worſhipped in Truth, and with a Clear, upright mind.</p>
               <p>Let our Prince therefore be ſure, that he approve himſelf to be a Pious, and Religious Prince, without <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> (by which <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> did himſelf much wrong,) and without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſoftneſſe, or Effeminateneſſe. But nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends a Prince to his People, then to be furniſhed both with Domeſtick, and Military Vertues; which are ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all his ſubjects, of all Ranks and Conditions whatſoever, to be faithful to Him: for, theſe are the Foundation, and Groundwork of all Principalities. For as the Elements, and all Bodies compounded of them, do without any Reluctancy obey the Motions of the Celeſtial Bodies, by reaſon of their Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit Excellencie of Nature; and in the Revolutions of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Orbes themſelves, the Inferiour follow the Motion of the Superiour; in like manner do all men willingly ſubmit, and yeeld themſelves up to ſuch a Prince, in whom they find all Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Vertues ſhining forth. For, this is an Impreſſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, imprinted on all, that no Inferiours refuſe to yeeld Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe that are above, or better then themſelves. <hi>For it is received by the Eternal Law of Nature, that Inferiours ſhould obey their Superiours: And it is the Bond of Faith,</hi> (ſaith Livy) <hi>to obey our betters.</hi> And, <hi>Our Superiours Commands are to be obeyed;</hi> ſaith another Author. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon requires, that thoſe that do excel in <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſhould govern thoſe that are not ſo excellent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>When any Prince therefore is Eminent for Vertue, it gains Him the Love of his People: eſpecially, if he ſhall but make it appear to them, that He loves them with a Fatherly Love, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to come into his preſence, and to diſcourſe with Him, and withall looking into the Accounts of His Inferiour Miniſters; and alwayes more readily lending an ear to the Poor, then to the Rich: and beſides, if He pardon all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and beſtow all Rewards Himſelf, but inflict puniſhments on Malefactors, by his Miniſters: and alſo, if He ſuppreſſe Uſurers, and thoſe Mercenary Barons, ſpoken of before; and ſhew Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118554:54"/>clear from all Wicked Acts whatſoever: and withall render Himſelf worthy to be reverenced for his Religion, by having Godly Counſellors about Him, and winning to himſelf a holy love from all, by reaſon of the moſt ſtrict Tye that is between Him and the Pope, and the Holy Church. And let Him in all things Propoſe for Examples for Him to follow, <hi>David, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, Theodoſius, Trajan, Auguſtus, Martianus, Charles</hi> the <hi>Great:</hi> all which being endowed with the forementioned Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and with Sciences, raigned more happily, then <hi>Julian, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, Henry, Tiberius, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Faire,</hi> who ſpent his time in a quite contrary courſe to what <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I would have Him to invite his Subjects, by honours and Rewards, to an Emulation of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and an Endeavour to excel each other herein: by which means there would be <hi>New Sciences</hi> invented. Gaming alſo would be of good uſe in Spain, and would ſerve to divert the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from prying over-curiouſly into Affairs of State: or elſe it would neceſſitate thoſe, that have loſt all their Eſtates that way, to turn Souldiers. But yet, ſeeing that this breaking of one another is the cauſe of Extortion, Covetouſneſſe, Hatred of their fellow Subjects, and of the love of Mony; this <hi>Gaming</hi> ſeems in the end to bring more damage to the State, then benefit. And therefore I conceive it were better that there were ſome Sports of Recreation deviſed for his Subjects of Spain to try Maſteries in; and ſome Velitations, and Innocent Contentions in ſome Arts, or Sciences: but for his Forraign ſubjects abroad they ſhould uſe <hi>Gaming,</hi> either at Cards, or Dice; which they ſhould be put upon by the Leiger Ambaſſadours there: that ſo by this means they may become Broken, and Heartleſſe, through Idleneſſe, and want of Exerciſe. I would alſo have ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical, Philoſophical, and Politicall Queſtions propoſed among them, that they may ſo be diverted from embracing Heretical Opinions.</p>
               <p>But the beſt courſe the King can take, for the preventing of all Conſpiracies, and deſigns againſt Him, will be, to ſhew Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Good, Awful,</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> Prince.</p>
               <p>The want of the Firſt of theſe Vertues was the Ruin of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and <hi>Acciolinus;</hi> the Defect in the ſecond, undid <hi>Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius;</hi> and the failing in the laſt coſt <hi>Philip,</hi> King
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118554:55"/>of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> his life: who becauſe he had denied the due Courſe of Juſtice to one <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> was by him killed. Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity alſo and Injuſtice was the Cauſe of the Ruin of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If any one Single perſon have any Treacherous Deſign againſt the Prince, the only Courſe in that caſe for prevention of it, will be, to take notice of, and fearch every one that comes into the Kings preſence, leaſt they ſhould carry any Armes Privily about them; for it is a difficult buſineſſe to prevent ſuch Treacheries, as are deſigned by One ſingle Perſon alone. And hence it was, that <hi>Henry</hi> the III. of <hi>France,</hi> and the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> and ſo likewiſe <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> were all Slain by ſingle perſons; the Firſt of them, for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the ſecond, for his Cruelty; and the Third, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Juſtice to be done to a Subject of his. But if there be Many joyned together in any Conſpiracy againſt the Prince, it cannot be, but that unleſſe they effect their deſign within fifteen, or twenty daies ſpace; or, except the Conſpirators have fallen upon their Deſign out of their Love, and reſpect they bear to Juſtice, Piety, or the benefit of the Publick, and ſo it prove to be onely a Conſpiracy contrived by Honeſt Men againſt a Tyrant; it cannot otherwiſe be, I ſay, but that they muſt neceſſarily be diſcovered; For, every body will hope, ſome way or other to advance himſelf by the Prince's Favour, if he do but diſcover the ſaid Conſpiracy to him. And hence it was, that the Conſpiracy of <hi>Abſolon</hi> againſt his father <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Catiline</hi> againſt his Country were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; becauſe that thoſe, that were the Conſpirators, were nothing at all better, or honeſter men, then thoſe againſt whom they had conſpired. Conſpiracies are alſo eaſily, and ſpeedily too, diſcovered by ſervants; unleſſe they be preſently put into Execution; as was that of <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> againſt Duke <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was deferred but one night onely. And whenſoever Honeſt Men joyn in any Conſpiracy againſt a moſt Cruel Tyrant; notwithſtanding they ſhould delay the putting of the ſame in execution, yet would there be no great danger of its being diſcovered; and hence it was, that the Conſpiracy of <hi>John de Precitha,</hi> and the Barons of <hi>Sicily,</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who miſerably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the poor Inhabitants, was kept cloſe above a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118554:55"/>the Execution of it: and that too, though both the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who were Forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were all privy to the Same: the only Reaſon of which was, becauſe that This was a Conſpiracy made by the Nobles and others, that were therein concerned, againſt Forraigners, and Tyrannical Governours. The like was that Conſpiracy alſo, which was entred into by <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> againſt <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.</hi> And yet, for the moſt part, although the number of thoſe that are in the Conſpiracy be but of a few, and it be beſides contrived againſt ſome Wicked perſon too; yet if it be not ſpeedily put in Execution, it comes to light, and is diſcovered; as we may ſee by that Conſpiracy made againſt <hi>Nero;</hi> in which even <hi>Seneca</hi> himſelf alſo was; and that Other contrived againſt <hi>Coſmo de Medicis</hi> by the Wicked <hi>Strozzi,</hi> who were themſelves much worſe then He.</p>
               <p>But in caſe any ſingle perſon, aſpiring to ſome Principality, ſhall yet bear his followers in hand, that He drives at ſome other thing, and ſo in the mean time winnes upon them, and gaines their Affections; He ſhall certainly bring about his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
               <p>This was the courſe that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> took, in attaining to the Empire; though He kept his Deſign cloſe to Himſelf, and never diſcovered it to any; being yet wont, while He was but a Youth, to have this ſaying often in his mouth: <hi>Si violandum eſt jus, Regnandi gratiâ violandum eſt:</hi> If I would violate the Lawes, it ſhould be, to <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of this Deſign of his, he laid for himſelf Two Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; namely, <hi>Religion,</hi> and The <hi>Love of the Souldiery;</hi> to whom at length He made known his purpoſe, though under an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Pretext. Whereas <hi>Catiline</hi> in his attempting the ſame, took a quite Contrary Courſe; and having laid down to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before hand no one particular Foundation, He, without any more ado, at firſt made all of his fellow Conſpirators acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his drift, and purpoſe. By whoſe Miſcarriage <hi>Caeſar</hi> taking warning, He attempts the ſame thing, but with more Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Adviſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>The King therefore ought to uſe all diligence and care, to diſcover how the Minds of His Subjects, and Miniſters ſtand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118554:56"/>toward Him, and what they have in agitation amongſt them: and when He hath once found what they would have, He ſhall do well, immediately to give them Satisfaction in that Particular. And beſides, it would not be amiſſe, that He ſhould beſtow ſome gifts, under hand, yet without any ſhew at all of fear, or ſuſpition, upon ſome one Principal perſon among the Conſpirators; who, being by this meanes wrought over to the Prince, will be able to acquaint Him with what ever Deſigns his Subjects have in hand. And if any ſhall inform Him, that there are certain Perſons, that have for many months together been openly contriving ſome conſpiracy againſt Him; He may very well laugh at ſuch Informers. For, whoſoever ſhall go about to attempt any ſuch thing in that manner, are either Fooles, or very Unskilful in the Courſe of the World; or elſe, laſtly, thoſe that gave him ſuch Information, are Liers, and forged thoſe Stories, only to ingratiate themſelves with the Prince, and get into Favour with him. Thus heretofore <hi>Perſeus</hi> falſely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Brother <hi>Demetrius,</hi> of having Secretly conſpired againſt their Father, <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And in the Reigne of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Nero,</hi> there were every day ſome or other, that accuſed others of Treaſonable Deſigns againſt the Emperour; Which certainly is a very Villanous, baſe thing; for by this meanes the Prince is both made to ſuſpect every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and beſides, He renders Himſelf withal ſuſpected by every body; ſo that the Subjects are put to act really upon Him that which Himſelf ſtands in fear of; or elſe, Innocent men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly put to death; both which things are of very ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a Kingdom. He ought rather therefore to ſeem not to believe any ſuch Accuſations, although perhaps they ſhould be true, unleſſe they be alſo manifeſtly proved; except they be ſuch, as wherein Religion is concerned. For, by ſo doing, He will ſhew himſelf to be a juſt, and Good Prince, and ſuch a one, as doth the leaſt in the World deſerve to have any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies contrived againſt him; and ſo alſo the Conſpirators themſelves will preſently lay aſide the Ill Opinion they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of Him. In the mean time, for the Prince to cauſe any of his Subjects to be thought guilty of Rebellion, and Treaſon, when no ſuch thing can be proved againſt them, is but a very ſad buſineſſe; for then, out of the ſenſe of the Infamy that is caſt upon them, they will be forced to deſire a Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118554:56"/>and will invite the Kings Enemies to invade him; which hath often happened both in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding that there ſeems to be ſome hope of gain iſſuing from thence; becauſe an Occaſion may hereupon be taken of keeping a ſtricter hand over the Subject; (which advantage being readily apprehended by the forementioned <hi>Coſmo de Medicis,</hi> he took an Occaſion preſently to break off the Articles of Peace that had been concluded upon betwixt him and the <hi>Florentines;</hi> in like manner as our King alſo, upon the like Occaſion held a harder hand over the <hi>Arragonians,</hi> upon Pretenſe that they had entred into Conſpiracy againſt Him with <hi>Antonio Perez;</hi>) yet, in truth, the King receives more damage, then Advantage thereby. And therefore the more ſure, and certain way, to confirm and aſſure his Kingdom to himſelf, would be, ſo to winne over the People to him by Mutual Love, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours beſtowed upon them, that they ſhould not have any ground to have any ſuch Suſpicions of him. And beſides, where this note of Infamy is thrown upon the Subjects; not only themſelves, but their Children alſo will be ſure to preſerve the memory of it, and ſo will watch for ſome fit opportunity of Revenge; which when it offers it ſelf, they will not ſtick openly to joyn with Forreigners againſt him; and thus their Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Deſigns are not by thoſe meanes quite quaſhed, but are deferred only. And hence it was, that <hi>Nero's</hi> hoping to get mony out of the People, about the Firſt Conſpiracy againſt himſelf, and ſo by puniſhing them, to benefit himſelf, did not at all ſuppreſſe the ſaid Conſpiracy, but only put it off, till ſome other time: which alſo the Senatours afterwards ſet on foot again, but with greater care, and circumſpection: as it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe happened to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and other wicked Princes.</p>
               <p>If any ſuch thing therefore ſhould befall our Prince, He ſhould endeavour to obliterate, and blot out the memory of ſuch Rebellions, by Benefits, rather then Puniſhments; by that means both putting a bridle into their mouthes, and yet withall ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, and winning them over to Himſelf by his bounty; ſo much more advantagious is it for a Prince, at all times, and in all places, to approve Himſelf rather <hi>Good,</hi> then <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:118554:57"/>
               <p>But yet it cannot be denied, but that ſuch Conſpiracies are moſt dangerous, which are countenanced by the Pretext of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a <hi>New Religion;</hi> or, when any <hi>Seditious Preacher</hi> takes liberty to caſt Reproaches upon the State. And therefore I ſhall ſay ſomething, in my following diſcourſe, touching <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> both <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Bad;</hi> and afterwards alſo of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting,</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> or falling off of Kingdomes, and Countries from one another.</p>
               <p>I would alſo have Severer Puniſhments, and more examplary peeces of Juſtice then uſual, (if it may be) to be at once, and ſpeedily inflicted upon all Conſpirators; leaſt, by often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of lighter Puniſhments upon them, their Hate be thereby the more encreaſed, and ſhew it ſelf upon all Occaſions. But again, if any ſuch, having made their eſcapes, ſhall yet, after ſome ſpace of time, begin to be humbled, and repent of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; I would not that all hope of Pardon, and Reconciliation ſhould be cut off from them. As for the Preventing of the Barons riſing againſt the King, the courſes before laid down may be taken.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Hereſies</hi> can ſpread, or get any footing any where, but by the Clergy; as I have demonſtrated elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The King's Deputies, or Viceroyes ought to have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over any Caſtles, or Frontier Townes that have Garriſons in them: but all ſuch places are to be committed to the truſt of ſome Particular Commanders reſiding in the ſame, and who are Experienced Souldiers, and betwixt whom and the Viceroyes there is no great correſpondence. And let theſe be choſen out of the Barons of the Kingdome; that ſo their Baronies, or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips may be as Pledges for their Fidelity to the King. And to this end, I would have <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, <hi>Italians</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> to take upon them theſe Charges.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is certain, that the People, eſpecially of a certain number of Kingdomes, are of more power, then the King himſelf, with all his Friends and Souldiers: I mean, in the Chriſtian World; for in <hi>Turky,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no, is as yet ſomething a doubtful buſineſſe. It is therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to produce here ſome reaſons, why the People do not, upon every light Occaſion riſe up againſt the King, and ſhake the Yoak from off their neck: and theſe are, becauſe that being ſo ſcattered, and at ſuch a diſtance from one another, they cannot ſo well joyn in a body, and ſtick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or elſe, becauſe they are worthleſſe, dull-headed fellowes, and have none to head them in a Rebellion, in whom they may repoſe their confidence and hope. Now it is manifeſt again on the other ſide, that the Cauſes of the Publick peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, do derive their Original from the Wiſedome of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and others of the Clergy, to whom the people give an ear; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe Theſe promiſe unto them Eternal Bleſſings, which, if they do but deſpiſe their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, they may attain unto: perſwading them withal, that it is agreeable to the Will of God, that Obedience ſhould be yeilded to the King; and, that by ſuffering Afflictions, they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by God himſelf; withal often inculcating into their minds Humility, and other the like Vertues; but grievouſly threatning all Theeves, Murderers, Whoremongers, and Seditious perſons, declaring what Puniſhments, both from Men, and God himſelf, continually hang over their heads: on the contrary, comforting, and encouraging the Good, and promiſing them all manner of Happineſſe. And ſo by this meanes, the words of theſe men being greedily hearkned unto by their Auditors, overcome, and captivate their Minds and Affections: and then again, all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Irreligious perſons are caſt out of doors, with their Perfidious deſigns; being unable to infect any, either Magiſtrate, or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, with their corrupt, malitious Perſwaſions, or by any means to incite them to a Rebellion.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:118554:58"/>
               <p>The Firſt Inſtrument therefore of Raigning well, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the <hi>Tongue;</hi> and the Second is, the <hi>Sword:</hi> And the truth of this will beſt of all appear, by the contrary Uſe of It. For, whenſoever any Seditious Preachers riſe up againſt the King, they are able in a ſhort time to bring the people, that before diſſented in Judgments, to be now of one and the ſame mind, and will adde courage to every Seditious ſpirit, and ſo will make themſelves the Heads, and Ringleaders of ſedition; by which Princes have oftentimes been brought into very great Straits; and, which is more, have ſometimes alſo loſt their Lives thereby. An example of this kind may be <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſtirred up the People againſt <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour. The like whereof hath of late years been practiſed by <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> againſt an Infinite number of Princes: and theſe two have done more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief with their <hi>Tongue,</hi> then either <hi>Marcus Sciarra,</hi> or <hi>Ninus Martinus</hi> did with their Swords.</p>
               <p>Thus again, on the contrary, <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> with his Tongue only ſuppreſſed the Mutinying Commons of <hi>Rome,</hi> and made them again to yield Obedience to the Senat, againſt whom they had ſhamefully riſen up. The Pope alſo hath often by his Preachers repreſſed Rebellions that were now broken out, and grown high: Nay, He by this means preſerved, and upheld the Weſtern Empire, when by the Rhetorick of his Divine <hi>Tongue,</hi> he diverted <hi>Attila,</hi> the <hi>Hunne</hi> from deſtroying all <hi>Italy,</hi> and made him return home again. King <hi>Ahab</hi> alſo was brought to deſtruction by the <hi>Tongue</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Elijah;</hi> as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was by <hi>Ahijah's.</hi> And therefore Good <hi>Preachers</hi> ought to be had in high eſtimation, eſpecially if they be Good Men, and are able to confirm that which they ſay, both by Miracles, and by ſtrong Reaſons: like as <hi>Moſes</hi> confounded <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Emperours <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Henry;</hi> and as the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> performed that, which He had conceived by Divine Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>It is certain therefore, that Tumults, and Mutinies may be ſtirred up among the People, by the Eloquence of ſuch perſons, as are Powerful with them, and in high eſteem among them: and therefore ſuch are to be had in reverence, whether they be Good men, or Bad; and they are to be made your friends. For, if they be Good men, they are then ſo powerful by their Divine Authority, as that there can be no Oppoſition made againſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118554:58"/>them. Look upon <hi>Samuel,</hi> who ſet <hi>Saul</hi> upon the Throne; and ſhortly after depoſed Him again, and ſet up <hi>David</hi> upon it. And ſo likewiſe, what is it, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not able to do, in this kind? For as much as His Supream Authority, joyned with Sermons, is of much greater force and power. And Biſhops, in this caſe, would alſo be very powerful, if they would but take upon themſelves to diſcharge the duty of Preachers. How ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> oppoſe the rage and fury of the Empreſſe <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> and her Party! And St. <hi>Bernard</hi> alſo made himſelf very formidable both to the Cardinals, and to the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſetting at oddes, and reconciling Princes and their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he pleaſed himſelf: as his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> do ſufficiently teſtifie. And I am verily perſwaded, that if all Princes and Nations ſhould joyn their Forces together, for the Overthrowing of the <hi>Popedome,</hi> they would not be able to effect it: for thus much Chriſt hath alſo promiſed to his Church; <hi>Whatſoever ye bind on earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever ye looſe on earth,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt It.</hi> And if there were but one Expedition onely of <hi>Croiſades</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be ſet forth, all perſons that are of any Religious Orders whatſoever, (and of theſe there are certainly many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) would queſtionleſſe immediatly flock together with their Armes; and making uſe both of their Tongues, and Swords, would be able to make reſiſtance againſt, and to ſtrike a terrour into the Whole World. For indeed all people would be afraid to make uſe of their Armes againſt perſons that are in Sacred Orders: and yet if ſome few of them ſhould dare to do this, yet would the Major part of them lay down Their Armes; and ſo the reſt, being by this means diſheartned, would not make any Oppoſition againſt them.</p>
               <p>Do but take notice, if you pleaſe, how <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, being accompanied onely with the Levites and Prieſts, yet took up armes againſt the Rebellious People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and againſt their Princes, who, together with their Wives, were above a Million in number; and how with the Armes of one ſingle Tribe onely, and that too of the Prieſts,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Text ſaith onely</hi> 3000. Exod. 32.28.</note> he killed <hi>thirty three</hi> Thouſand men in one day, and reduced the reſt into Obedience. For, where the True Religion joyneth Armes and Preaching together, there is no Power ſo great, as to be able to make reſiſtance againſt it. The <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo ſoon as ever they perceived the Power of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118554:59"/>New growing Chriſtian Religion, they preſently took up Armes againſt It, killing and impriſoning the Chriſtians every where; yet were they fain at laſt to give way to It: until at length Themſelves alſo, in the time of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, embraced the Chriſtian Faith. And although that a Biſhop, or the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf ſhould chance to be a Wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet if any Prince ſhall draw his Sword againſt him, he ſhall be overcome, though the Conquerour: Of which we had a plain example in <hi>Roger Guiſcard,</hi> King of <hi>Naples;</hi> who though he got the Victory in the Battel, yet was he afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to kiſſe the <hi>Popes</hi> Foot. A Remedy againſt which ſome Kings conceiving they had found out, (among which number was <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. King of <hi>England</hi>) they betook themſelves to Apoſtaſy; and yet nevertheleſſe did They alſo come to Ruin: and this very thing would bring, if it ſhould be attempted, the moſt certain deſtruction upon <hi>Spain</hi> alſo; as we have formerly ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Some others have thought it the beſt courſe to caſt the <hi>Popes</hi> into Priſon; which <hi>Philip</hi> K. of France made bold to practiſe upon Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth: and in like manner St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was heretofore ſent into baniſhment by The Emperour <hi>Arcadius;</hi> which yet was deſtructive to both theſe Princes. For, <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> was called home again, and reſtored to his Seat with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour, by occaſion of <hi>Gaina</hi> the Goth his taking up Armes againſt the ſaid Emperour: notwithſtanding that <hi>Gaina</hi> himſelf could not be preſerved in the Church, becauſe he was an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of that Religion that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was of. And the King of <hi>France,</hi> after he had by <hi>Boniface's</hi> means brought it ſo about, that a Frenchman was choſen Pope, hoping by this meanes His Offence would eſcape unpuniſhed, he fomented and kept up the Breach, that at that time was riſen in the Church, and ſent <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> V. the new Elected Pope, to <hi>Avignon,</hi> to keep his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there; but all to no purpoſe: For this very Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> by the advice of Cardinal <hi>Brateus,</hi> deceived his Kings expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in not keeping thoſe Promiſes that he had made to him. And indeed, from that time forward, the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> ſeems to have been continually in declining; as appears plainly out of Hiſtory. It is therefore a Profane Remedy, to lay hands upon, or to attempt any thing againſt the perſon of a Prieſt.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:118554:59"/>
               <p>Other Princes again have elected <hi>Anti-popes;</hi> as did the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> by which meanes they were afflicted worſe then before. Others have ſummoned ſuch Biſhops and Popes as have been obſtinate, perverſe Perſons, and enemies to them, to appear before a General Councel: but this deviſe of theirs the Pope hath now eluded; it being openly delared to all the World, that a Generall Councel hath no power at all over the Pope; and a Decree being alſo made, That No Councel ſhall be called, but by the Pope alone. And for this reaſon did Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. ruine thoſe Cardinals that were preſent at the Councel of <hi>Piſa;</hi> and yet neither did their friends, the Princes, obtain what they deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ecleſiaſtical</hi> Princes have alwaies been wiſer then Secular; ſome of whom have found a remedy for this Evil, by yeilding, and ſubmitting themſelves; as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour humbled himſelf before that Good Biſhop, St <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> and the Kings of the <hi>Goths</hi> left <hi>Rome,</hi> and went to <hi>Ravenna</hi> to reſide; giving way to the Popes, as well to the Bad, as the Good. And That King of <hi>England</hi> alſo, by whoſe command <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was murdered, made choyce rather to enter into Conditions of Peace with the <hi>Pope,</hi> then to loſe his Kingdom; and ſo was forced to pay yearly to the <hi>Pope</hi> forty Thouſand Marks of Gold; and beſides, at his death, he made the <hi>Pope</hi> his heir to the Kingdom by his laſt Will and Teſtament. After the Example of theſe Princes, it will behoove the King of Spain alſo to give way to the Pope, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He be Good, or Bad; and to lay aſide what Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ſoever he ſhall have with him, and to leave ſuch Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops as are his enemies, to be chaſtiſed by the Pope, to whom He muſt wholly unite himſelf by thoſe waies which are before ſet down. <hi>Alexander,</hi> the King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> having drawn upon himſelf the hatred of the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> and being now upon his death bed, perſuaded his wife (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifies) that by all meanes ſhe ſhould take him, and throw him down headlong out at the Window; telling her, that by ſo doing ſhe ſhould give full ſatisfaction to the incenſed <hi>Phariſes,</hi> who, after ſhe had done that Act, would ſuffer her to ſucceed him in the Kingdom; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Counſel beſides, that ſhe ſhould ever take heed how ſhe fell out with any <hi>Religious</hi> perſons, leaſt ſhe ſuffered that which himſelf had done.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:118554:60"/>
               <p>But if ſuch men as are Authoriſed by no Superiour Power, (eſpecially if they be Clergy men, ſuch as were <hi>Arrius, Savana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi>) ſhall riſe up againſt any State, this is a very dangerous caſe: and it muſt then be enquired into, whether theſe men have any encouragement from the Pope to do ſo, or not: for, if ſo be they have, and He contradicts them not, then is the Evill in a manner Incurable; but if they have not Him for their Abettor, then may an order be very eaſily taken with them. For here it is neceſſary that it be conſidered, whether theſe Men be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad;</hi> (for both may prove very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) and if they are <hi>Bad,</hi> they muſt then be rooted out by the Authority of the Pope; but if they are <hi>Good</hi> men, they muſt then be cited to appear before a <hi>General Councel;</hi> where, by the Authority of the Pope being alſo interpoſed, they may be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced; in like manner as <hi>Berengarius,</hi> being convinced of his Errour, yeilded to the Truth, and ſubmitted; and this is the Courſe that ought to be taken, where the Parties are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and really <hi>Good</hi> men, and not meer Hypocrites onely. But if they maintain a Good Cauſe, thoſe Faults, which they did inveigh againſt in their Sermons, are to be mended; and they themſelves are to be ſent for away to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they ſhould afterwards ſpend the reſt of their Lives; as was done by <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomaeus Miranda,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Curzola,</hi> who was expelled from his Biſhoprick by the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> If they are Lay-men, as was <hi>John of Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> there is no great danger to be feared from them; For, theſe two, after the breach had been firſt made by <hi>Luther,</hi> at length roſe up; and when now <hi>Luther</hi> had already ſetled his Erroneous Religion, and falſe Prieſthood in <hi>Germany.</hi> But in our Dominions, no One Lay-man whatſoever would be able to bring about ſuch a buſineſſe, without the aſſiſtance of ſome one of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>It is an Infallible Rule, that no Hereſie did ever do any hurt in a Country, unleſſe the Prince himſelf of that Country, for ſome Reaſons of State, afforded ſome Patronage to the ſame: as I have ſhewed where I diſcourſed touching the <hi>Papal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> It will therefore concern all Princes to take care, that their Nobles alſo be not infected with the ſaid Hereſie; which they may prevent, by taking them off with Employments, and ſo diverting their Minds from any ſuch thoughts; as I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:118554:60"/>
               <p>Now theſe Rules are to be diligently obſerved, with theſe aforeſaid Hereticks. You muſt be careful that you do not fall to diſpute with them about Minute Quirks, and ſubtilties in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but only that you require them to give you a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their <hi>Calling:</hi> and to produce the Names of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; after this manner, ſuppoſe. <hi>Who commanded you to teach theſe things publickly? Were they Men, or Divels rather? For we cannot believe, they ſhould be any other.</hi> And then, if they ſhall anſwer, that <hi>They have their Calling from God;</hi> let them then make the ſame appear to you, by doing ſome <hi>Miracles</hi> or other; ſuch as God heretofore armed His Meſſengers with, namely <hi>Moſes, Elijah,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And if they are not able to do any ſuch things, you ſhould then bring them to the Stake, and burn them, if you can, and render them as Infamous as poſſibly you may. But be ſure you avoid all <hi>Grammatical Diſputations,</hi> and <hi>Logical Subtilties;</hi> but diſpute with them only according to the Principles of <hi>Divine Logick;</hi> as St. <hi>Francis</hi> did in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and St. <hi>John Guidalbert;</hi> and as I my ſelf have endeavoured to do, in my <hi>Dialogues</hi> againſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> laying down a way, how they are to be convinced by an Apoſtolical, and Political way; leaſt out of multiplying idle, and vain words, one Controverſie may ſtill be ſtarted out of another; which to perverſe, and Malicious ſpirits will be taken for a kind of Victory. I would alſo have them condemned to be Burnt out of the <hi>Imperial Conſtitutions;</hi> for as much as they rob Perſons in Authority of their Goods, and <hi>Good name,</hi> (ſuch as are the Pope, and other Religious, and Pious men, who have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Faith of the Church, and ſealed it with their Blood;) which indeed is more precious then what ever other Treaſures in the World: and therefore whoſoever they are, that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to, and perverſly oppoſe ſuch Perſons, and ſeduce others to do the like, they juſtly deſerve to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Rule is, that all care be taken, that there be no fruits ſuffered to ſpring from ſuch branches: for the hindering whereof, the beſt courſe would be, to prefer only men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts to Biſhopricks and Benefices; and withal you are to conſider that ſuch, if they be good Men, will be of good uſe to you, nor will ever ſcatter abroad any Peſtilent Opinions: ſuch as were <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> among the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> There are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118554:61"/>alſo other Good men to be found, that are able to act pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully on either part; ſuch as were among the Heathen, <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> both which were the Authors of much good, and as much evil to their Countries, according as they were led by the Occaſion, and preſent neceſſity upon them: as, among the Chriſtians, were <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Sergius;</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recanted, as it were, all that ever they had before Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preached and taught.</p>
               <p>And therefore it concerns the Prince, that he ſhew himſelf Favourable, and Gracious to all Learned Men; ſeeing that he cannot be able to ſee ſo far into them, as to know what their Inclinations are. And let him uſe all the means he can, to know who are the moſt excellent for Learning in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and having notice of them, let Him invite them to him, and find Imployments for them; preventing even the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in beſtowing perferments on them: and theſe he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and provoke to ſhew their abilities againſt the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. One only Monk converted all <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith: and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, that extraordinary favourer, and Patron of all that were Eminent for Learning, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whether they were Laicks, or Clergy-men, ſubdued <hi>Gotland, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> with a great part of <hi>Germany</hi> alſo, by the means of theſe Men; whom alſo He rewarded moſt magnificently. In the Conqueſt alſo of the <hi>New World,</hi> the Monks were of more uſe, and did more good, then the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>And the like might alſo be effected both in <hi>China, Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> Wherefore New Sciences are to be introduced, and New <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> together with the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſtudy of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue is to be taken up, (ſeeing that the Empires of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are now quite extinct) that ſo, by the uſe thereof, the <hi>Turks</hi> may be the better convinced of their Errour.</p>
               <p>Let there be alſo certain Aſſemblies erected, conſiſting of the wiſeſt perſons that can be pickt out both of the Religious Order of the Friers, and out of the Laity; whoſe buſineſſe it ſhall be, to deliberate about ſuch things as concern the State: that ſo their Wits being wholly taken up with the meditating about theſe things, they may wholly ſerve the Prince; and him only, and not deſign any thing to his diſadvantage; while
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118554:61"/>their own only Ambitions will be, who ſhall deſerve beſt of the Prince; and ſo will have no other thoughts: And let him make it his buſineſſe, to get together as many of theſe men as he can; and withal let him be ſure, that they be all honeſt, good men. For, ſhould there be never ſo many of them, yet if they were ſuch as thoſe were that <hi>Jezabel</hi> had about her; one <hi>Elijah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a <hi>Good</hi> man, would eaſily confound them all, and bring them to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> alſo erected <hi>Greek</hi> Schooles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the end that, by that means, he might aboliſh the Wholſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Lawes that <hi>Moſes</hi> had given the Jewes; but all in vain; becauſe the <hi>Macchabees</hi> oppoſed themſelves againſt him. In like manner ought the King to ſet up many Chriſtian Catholick Schooles, and that, againſt the Enemies of Religion: for, by ſo doing, he ſhall render Himſelf ſecure, both from the Pope, and from his Enemies; and ſhall beſides reduce the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, and bring them under his ſubjection; as I have before declared.</p>
               <p>Neither would I have this one thing to be omitted; namely, that He erect certain Colledges through all the Provinces of his Dominions, in which ſhould be placed all the moſt Ingenious Boyes of the ſaid Provinces; (and who are ſuch, may eaſily be known, by their firſt Maſters, that taught them their Grammers, and other the Firſt Rudiments) and theſe, being thus culled out of all Grammer Schools, I would have to be brought up, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the Kings Charge; and there ſhould be a <hi>New Order</hi> ſet up of them, like that of St. <hi>Dominick;</hi> which <hi>Order</hi> I would have called, The <hi>Auſtrian Order.</hi> And when any of theſe were come to be 18. years old, they ſhould then be commanded to Preach: and theſe I would have to be called, <hi>The Kings Preachers;</hi> and they ſhould then be ſent abroad, ſome into <hi>Germany,</hi> and others into <hi>England:</hi> where, if they have managed their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes rightly, and well; at their return they ſhould have Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks conferred upon them by the King, of thoſe that are in the Kings own gift: for, by ſo doing, he ſhall render himſelf ſecure both from the Pope, and alſo againſt all perfidious Preachers and Hereticks; and by this meanes ſuch perſons only ſhall be maintained at His charge, as do him ſervice for it, and advance His affairs.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be expreſſed by words, what great advantages
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118554:62"/>He ſhall reap to himſelf hereby. For, among all ſorts of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks that are, there are none that are farther out of the way of Truth, then the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> are, who ſow abroad the Seeds of Sedition whereſoever they come, and endeavour to break aſunder the bonds of that Peace, which was made known unto the world by Angels, and publickly preached by Chriſt himſelf: and, who having neither any reſpect to Learning, nor regarding the Authority of the Fathers, do defend their own Sect by their Armes only, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do.</p>
               <p>There is need therefore here of the moſt Effectual Medicines that can be, againſt this Evil, theſe kind of Men; and that is, <hi>Principiis obſtare,</hi> To ſtop them in their Beginning: which courſe is to be obſerved in the Prevention of all Evils whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and then afterwards are thoſe other Remedies to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which are before ſet down; namely, for the converting of them: for which work there muſt be choſen out honeſt, and painful Labourers, who by the Purity of their Doctrine, and holineſſe of their Life, may reduce and winne back ſuch wandring ſheep, as have gone aſtray out of the Way of Truth.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>John</hi> the Third, erected in <hi>India</hi> certain Colledges and <hi>Seminaries,</hi> wherein are educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great number of young Youths of all ſorts, under the Diſcipline of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> who alſo have by this meanes done very much good both in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the <hi>New World.</hi> For, thoſe Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> in which theſe Jeſuits live, have alwaies ſtood firm in the Faith; and thoſe other, which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Venom of Hereſie, are cured thereof by their Means. But if there be no hopes at all left of reducing theſe men, and bringing them back again into the True Way, and making them to ſubmit themſelves to our Government and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; then muſt the King embrace that counſel which was given by <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> to <hi>Hoſtilius,</hi> for the keeping of the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> within the bounds of their Duty and Obedience; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let him ſo order the matter, as that they ſhould not be able to ſhake off the yoak, if they would never ſo fain. And this may be done, by obſerving theſe three things; namely, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be <hi>Low-ſpirited, Weak,</hi> and, laſtly, if they be <hi>Kept aſunder from one another:</hi> for, the Boldneſſe that any take upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118554:62"/>them, in attempting to caſt off the Yoak from their Necks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from their Height of <hi>Spirit,</hi> or from their <hi>Strength,</hi> or elſe from their <hi>Multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before theſe ſeverer Courſes are taken with them, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed, how mightily advantageous it would be to the buſineſſe in hand, if ſo be the Children of Infidels were put to ſuch Maſters as ſhould inſtruct them in the Arts, and Liberal Sciences, and all ſuch exerciſes as are fit for any Ingenuous Man to be brought up in: for, by this courſe alone, we ſhould at once oblige both the Children, and the Parents alſo to Us. We muſt therefore erect, as I ſaid before, <hi>Seminaries</hi> both for the <hi>Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Armes,</hi> which we call the <hi>Two Inſtruments</hi> of our <hi>Future Monarchy:</hi> the Former of theſe, for the reducing of all ſuch of our Subjects, as are Infidels, and Hereticks, and the bringing them back in a peaceable manner into the True Way, and to a Unity of Faith: and the Later, to the end that they may be utterly weakned, and deprived of all power, in caſe they ſhall ſtand out, and refuſe to return to the True Faith; of which we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoken elſewhere.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome are of Opinion, that it is Impoſſible, that the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ſtand long, as well becauſe almoſt All Other Nations are either Enemies to it, or at leaſt, not very good Friends; as alſo, by reaſon of the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſeveral parts of it from each other, ſome lying in the <hi>New World,</hi> and others lying ſcatteringly here and there like Iſlands, as in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and in <hi>Africk;</hi> all which are moſt different from one another, both in their Languages, Situation, and Temper of the Climate: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118554:63"/>the <hi>Turk,</hi> who layes claime to the Univerſal Empire of the whole World, hath his Dominions lying all cloſe together; and beſides, in his Wars, he obſerves the ſame Courſe that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> heretofore did, in making War alwayes upon his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours only, that lye round about him. Neither can the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or hatred of thoſe Nations that are his Enemies, do him any hurt at all; for as much as he brings up within his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions Young Children of all ſorts, of which afterwards he maketh Souldiers: ſo that his Empire ſeems in a manner to be nothing elſe, but a Military Republick. Neither can Religion at all hinder his proceedings; and beſides, his Baſhawes, or Governours of Provinces, have all of them an abſolute power of Rule given them; ſo that they need not ſtand in fear of poor naked, and unarmed People: whom, if they ſhould but offer to riſe, they would be able to ſuppreſſe by their own Sons.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever deſires to become a great Monarch, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoove him to be continually in making War upon all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that lye round about him; and to reduce them under his ſubjection as ſoon as poſſibly he can. For thus the <hi>Romans</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did, firſt of all ſetting upon the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and <hi>Latines:</hi> and then afterwards falling upon the <hi>Aequicolae,</hi> the <hi>Peligni,</hi> the <hi>Vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, Lucanians, Tuſcans,</hi> and <hi>Samnites,</hi> alwayes going round in a Circle, till at length, having ſubdued all <hi>Italy,</hi> they paſſed over into <hi>Sardinia, Sicily, Spain, Gaule,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> The ſelf ſame Courſe was taken by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> in their expeditions againſt thoſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The <hi>Macedonians</hi> did the like, making War upon the <hi>Thebans</hi> firſt; then falling upon the <hi>Epirotes, Lacedemonians, Achaians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians;</hi> and afterwards, paſſing over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> they filled it wholly with their Armies: in ſo much that at length, as <hi>Livy,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> write, they were ſo puft up with the glory of their Victories, as that they would have marcht on againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagineans</hi> alſo. Certainly, had not <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great been taken off by an untimely death, he would without all doubt have made an Expedition againſt the Romans alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that the Turk does at this day take the very ſame courſe, that the Greateſt Empires in former times did. For, having firſt ſubdued all <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> he then paſſed over into Europe, and conquered all <hi>Greece:</hi> next, he falls upon <hi>Syria,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118554:63"/>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Armenia;</hi> till at length he came as far as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi> Where, after he had taken in ſome certain Chriſtian provinces, and added them to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and that the Chriſtians now out of a General fear of being ſwallowed up by him, betook themſelves all to their Armes, and joyned their whole ſtrengths together againſt him; He then very craftily, and ſubtlely makes a Truce with them, and agrees upon conditions of Peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe things paſſing on thus, the Chriſtians in the mean while fall at variance among themſelves, and make war upon each other; ſo that the <hi>Turk</hi> being now ſecure from any Moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them, turnes his Victorious Armes againſt the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or <hi>Georgia:</hi> till ſuch time that, finding the Chriſtians all to peices again among themſelves, he thinks fit then to ſtrike up a Truce with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> or thoſe other of his enemies who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they were; and ſo falls on again upon the Chriſtians with all the ſtrength he hath, and does them what miſcheif lies in his Power. And then, while They are fain to ſpend time in conſulting what is to be done, the <hi>Turk,</hi> he goes on ſtill Victoriouſly, taking in now one Place, and then another, without controule. So great, and of ſo dangerous and ſad Conſequence are thoſe Inteſtine Diſſenſions, that are at this day kept up among the Chriſtian Princes! But the King of Spain, at one and the ſame time maintaines a War with ſeveral Nations; neither hath he at any time all his whole forces joyned together in any one Battel; by which meanes He utterly deſtroyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For, we ſhall have him making War. in the moſt Remote Parts of the World, whiles yet in the mean time He hath all his Neighbours, that lye round about Him, his enemies; as the <hi>Engliſh, French, Hollanders,</hi> and perhaps even the <hi>Italians</hi> themſelves alſo. Whence it may ſeem, that He takes a very croſſe, and unlikely way, for the enlarging of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Empire.</p>
               <p>But, to this Objection I Anſwer, that though much of this is true, yet the Courſe that the <hi>Turk</hi> takes is ſo blunt, and plain, that if he ſhould have but one overthrow, ſo that it were a luſty one indeed, it would prove his utter Ruin; (as I have hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) ſince that He hath no Vice-Roys, or Barons, by whom he might be recruited, and made whole again. But we cannot ſay ſo of the King of Spain; who, in ſuch a caſe, would preſently
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118554:64"/>be furniſhed with Aides from the Pope, and the Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and that by reaſon of their Union in point of Religion. I ſay moreover, that He cannot ſuffer any Notable Overthrow, unleſſe it be by ſome very Potent Prince; ſuch a One as the great <hi>Turk</hi> is; who yet lying ſo very far remote from him, (as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great of old did from the <hi>Romans</hi>) cannot ſo quickly ruin him: whereas, on the Contrary, any Peaceable Agreement of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> among themſelves, if ſo be it were but Firm and Laſting, would utterly confound the <hi>Turk.</hi> And therefore I ſay, that although King <hi>Philips</hi> Kingdomes lye ſcattered far and near, yet his enemies alſo lye far aſunder one from another: and therefore it is clear, that his Emulators, the <hi>Italians, Tuſcans</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> will never enter into a Combination againſt him, unleſſe he Firſt give them ſome evident cauſe, and wrong them very much. Neither indeed will the Pope ever ſuffer any acts of Hoſtility to be done againſt His Catholick Majeſty; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is alſo moſt certain, that the Catholick Princes, both out of fear of the Hereticks, and alſo of the Authority of the Pope, will never attempt any ſuch thing. And the Hereticks are at very great Variance alſo amongſt themſelves; and for this reaſon <hi>Germany</hi> being divided into ſeverall ſmall Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, cannot do him any harm at all; and it is beſides, part of it, made ſubject to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Archdukes thereof, by the Emperours; and part alſo to certain Archbiſhops, who are withall ſecular Princes; as namely the Archbiſhops of <hi>Mentz,</hi> of <hi>Colen, Trevers, Salsburg, Strasburg,</hi> and <hi>Bamberg;</hi> and part alſo to the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can by no meanes make any Inſurrection againſt the King of Spain.</p>
               <p>The Lower <hi>Germany</hi> alſo is divided into more Common-Wealths then the other; all which bear Armes againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> though it be only to defend themſelves, and not to offend Him. And of this number are the Provinces of <hi>Holland, Friſland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi> Beſides, the Upper and the Lower <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manies</hi> differ very much in their Religion: which we may alſo ſay of the <hi>Danes, Norwegians, Tranſylvanians, Gotlanders, Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, French, Switzers,</hi> and <hi>Griſons:</hi> ſo that the King hath no need at all to fear, that theſe ſhould ever all joyn together againſt him: and beſides; the King retains a great part of theſe Nations in pay, and by that means keeps them his friends: and then, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118554:64"/>allied to him by Marriage, and ſo are in league and amity with him. So that He hath no body to ſtand in fear of, but only the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the King of <hi>England;</hi> which two Princes, by reaſon of their being of different Religions, can never agree together.</p>
               <p>Now although the King of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot as yet ſubdue the King of <hi>France,</hi> yet it makes very much for His Intereſt, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> being abſolved by the <hi>Pope,</hi> is returned again to the Obedience of the Church. For otherwiſe, he would have been the Head of all the <hi>Tranſalpine Hereticks,</hi> and would have marcht with an Army of them over into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice both of the Pope, and of our King: which None of the Hereticks hath to this day adventured to do, merely for want of a Powerful General to head them. Then beſides, there is a Diviſion broken out in <hi>France,</hi> betwixt the Catholicks and the Hereticks: and, which is the chiefeſt thing of all, there are in that Kingdome many Potent Biſhops, who would not by any means ſee <hi>Spain</hi> ruined. And laſtly, our Kings Subjects do not come into the field with Lances, Swords, and Horſes, as the <hi>French</hi> uſe to do; but they come into it armed with Guns, which are a kind of Arms that are fitter for the defending of ſtrong Holds and Fortifications, then for the ſetting upon an Enemy in an open Field. And hence it is, that the <hi>French</hi> are able indeed to reſiſt all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Attempts, but they cannot overcome them: for, in this caſe, the very Princes, and States of <hi>Italy,</hi> who have to this day alwaies held with the <hi>French,</hi> would go over to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> for it is their Deſign, to keep the Ballance alwaies ſo even betwixt theſe two Nations, as that neither of them may preponderate, and bear down the Scales, and ſo make a Prey of the Other: which <hi>Hiero,</hi> King of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> heretofore laboured to do, betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he failed of his purpoſe. Beſides the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot march with an Army into Spain, by reaſon of the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Places, and Caſtles that lye in his way, and are kept by the Spaniards, who are very well skilled in defending ſuch Places. Neither can he ſo ſoon march out with an Army againſt <hi>Millan,</hi> or <hi>Naples,</hi> but that the King of Spain can be much ſooner in <hi>France</hi> with an Army, and ſhall ſo force him to return back again, and defend his own Kingdom. Neither did the King of <hi>France</hi> ever paſſe over into <hi>Italy,</hi> unleſſe when he was aſſiſted
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118554:65"/>by the Pope, as the Expedition of Charles of <hi>Anjou</hi> teſtifies; or except he were called in by ſome Prince, or State of <hi>Italy;</hi> as Charles the Eighth was called in by the Duke of <hi>Millan:</hi> which yet at this time can hardly be done again. For, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were now afraid, that they would bring in a New Religion with them. And beſides it is a uſual thing, that that Prince that firſt calls Forraigners in to his aide, ſhall be firſt ruined by them: for, he muſt neceſſarily entertain them, and allow them Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; who after they have overcome the adverſe Party, will joyn with them, and ſo drive out Him, who called them firſt in. Examples of this we have in the <hi>Sforza's, Caſtruccio's,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> with many others; and alſo in the Pope himſelf; although his own Papal Authority reſtored him again. And therefore the Spaniard hath no need to fear the King of <hi>France</hi> much.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he hath much leſſe reaſon to ſtand in fear of them, ſeeing they are ſhut up within an Iſland: and we ſeldome ſee Iſlanders get any ſure footing, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of any part of a Forraign Continent. And therefore it is ſufficient for them, if they can keep their own; only they ſend out their Ships to fetch in Prizes by Sea: but for this Miſchief I ſhall hereafter ſet down a Remedy. Only let the King of Spain take care, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> joyn not their Navy with the <hi>Hollanders, Scots, Danes, Norwegians,</hi> and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zickers:</hi> for if they ſhould, they might then be able to overrun all Spain; as the <hi>Alans, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> did of old. And yet ſeeing that theſe Nations differ all in Religion, and the King of Spain doth craftily under hand ſow new ſeeds of Diſſention amongſt them, there is no great cauſe to fear, that they ſhould joyn their forces together upon any deſign.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee, what Spain is able to do within it ſelf, and by what means it may become Greater, and enlarge its Territories; laying down this for a Ground; That for the rendring of any Dominion whatſoever Firm, and Durable, it is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that there be firſt, a Natural Sociableneſſe, and an apt Correſpondence, among the ſubjects themſelves, and then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prince and the ſubjects; as there is in Mans body, betwixt the Members themſelves, and alſo betwixt them and the Head. Now this Natural Sociableneſſe is founded, firſt in the Man and Wife; then in the Father of the Family and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118554:65"/>with the reſt of his Family; and then again, in ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies being linked, and united together; then, in thoſe alſo, who are allied together by the Bond of Conſanguinity, or Affinity; and likewiſe, thoſe that live in one Common Aire, and Climate, enjoying the ſame Temper of the Heavens; as alſo, thoſe that agree in their Lawes, Manners, Cuſtomes, and ſtudies; whereto alſo we may add their uſing one Common Language, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all one &amp; the ſame Habit in Apparel. Neither do I account their Identity of <hi>Species</hi> or of <hi>Humanity,</hi> to be any ſmall Bond of this <hi>Natural ſociableneſſe;</hi> namely, becauſe they are All Men: and whereſoever Many of theſe Bonds &amp; Ties meet together, there alſo muſt neceſſarily be a Firmer, and more Durable Aſſociation made up, and a more laſting Dominion ſetled. Hence it is, that the Italians and the Spaniards do ſo readily jump and agree together; both becauſe they underſtand each the others Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and are alſo like each other in their Manners, Bodies, and their Rites and Cuſtomes; which can never be amongſt the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they differ among themſelves not only in their Language, and Manners, but are alſo of a different Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and temper. So the Spaniards would much more eaſily, be brought to enter into a league of Society and Friendſhip with the <hi>Africans,</hi> then with the <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> who are of a much more different Conſtitution from them. For, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards are Naturally Hot and Dry, and are therefore Lean, and of a <hi>Low Stature,</hi> being withal <hi>Sharp-witted, Subtle,</hi> and <hi>Talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> But on the Contrary, the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> are <hi>Cold, Corpulent,</hi> and <hi>Big-boned,</hi> and are Heavy and <hi>Dull,</hi> and of few words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whoſoever therefore is to Rule Several, and Different Nations, and would keep them all within the bounds of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, let him endeavour to reduce them into a conformity, as far as he is able, and to make them in all things like to each other. And this Uniting of Men to one another, God himſelf, the Author of all Polity, had pointed out unto Men.</p>
               <p>Now, there are Three ſorts of this Union we here ſpeak of: the Firſt is, of Minds, which is cauſed by Religion: which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſtrongeſt of all Unions; for it uniteth together in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nations, that are at the greateſt diſtance that may be from each other. Upon this have both Mens Wills, and Actions, their Dependancy; and in This; are both their Tongues &amp; Arms uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. By this, the Pope ruleth over <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africk,</hi> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118554:66"/>
                  <hi>America;</hi> and in a word, over all the Chriſtians in the whole World. Whereas, on the contrary, the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> is ſcarſe able to Rule <hi>Germany</hi> alone, although the People there are otherwiſe as like, and as much agreeing among themſelves as may be, both in their ſhape of Body, Habit, Arms, Rites, and Cuſtomes; and all, becauſe It wants this firſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> namely, of <hi>Religion.</hi> For, there are ſo many ſeveral, different <hi>Opinions</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> among the <hi>Germans,</hi> that it may be truly ſaid of them, <hi>Quot homines, tot Sententiae;</hi> ſo many Men, ſo many Minds. And for this reaſon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Helvetians</hi> ſuffer but two ſorts only of Religion in their Countries: for that common ſaying, <hi>Divide, &amp; impera,</hi> that is, <hi>Divide thy ſubjects, and thou ſhalt rule them,</hi> is of no uſe here; but rather on the contrary, <hi>Divide, &amp; perdes,</hi> that is, <hi>If thou devide thy ſubjects, thou ſhalt ruin thy ſelf. Catharine de Medicis,</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> that ſhe might, contrary to the <hi>Salique Law,</hi> ſit at the Helme, and have the Government of the Kingdome in her hands, complied ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and ſometimes with the <hi>Huguenots:</hi> but by this means ſhe brought deſtruction both upon her ſelf, and upon her Sons; one of which was Slain by a <hi>Dominican Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefere, in this Particular, the King of Spain is more happy then any other beſides; becauſe that his Kingdomes, though they lye at a great diſtance from one another, are yet all joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and united in one Religion; and in this very reſpect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſtands upon better terms then the Great Turk himſelf, or any other Prince whatſoever; becauſe, as we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, He converts thoſe that are under his ſubjection, and makes them to be all of one and the ſame Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of <hi>Bodies:</hi> and in this, the Turk goes beyond all other Princes; for He hath under his ſubjection, and in perfect Obedience, both <hi>Mahumetans, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Jewes,</hi> which are all as much differing one from another in their Religions as can be: neither doth this their diverſity of Religion preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice him at all; becauſe that he brings up their Sons to ſerve him in his Wars; and beſides, He leaves all ſuch of his Subjects, as are not of his Religion, without either Armes, or any meanes poſſible of doing him any harm. But indeed, in caſe He ſhould intruſt any of theſe with the Government of any part of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and ſhould exerciſe, not a <hi>Deſpotical,</hi> but a <hi>Political</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingty
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118554:66"/>over them. He would quickly be brought into Sad Straites by them; as we ſee it, for example, in many of our <hi>German</hi> Princes at this day; or at leaſt all meanes of enlarging his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire would quite be cut off from him; as, we ſee, the caſe now ſtands with the Emperour, and with the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> If haply among the Turks Vaſſals there ſhould chance to ſtart up ſome Gallant-Spirited Perſon, he might poſſibly prove to be the Ruin of his Empire; as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had like to have been, had he had but the Chriſtians as ready to aſſiſt him, as the <hi>Genueſes</hi> were to do him a miſchief; who both to their own, and alſo to the great Loſſe of <hi>Hunniades</hi> K. of <hi>Hungary,</hi> were hired, for ſo many Crownes, to paſſe over forty Thouſand Mahumetans out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe;</hi> by which meanes <hi>Amurath,</hi> that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a manner utterly broken, and had well near loſt all, was now ſo well relieved and recruited again, as that by theſe forces He afterwards made himſelf Maſter of half <hi>Europe.</hi> I ſhall not here ſpeake of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was raiſed up againſt God by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi> according to which example God may alſo raiſe up ſome of the Turks Chriſtian Slaves againſt him. The like Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection may alſo poſſibly utterly Subvert the Spaniſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>The Third is, the Union of Monies and Riches, by meanes whereof the <hi>Turk</hi> commands the <hi>Raguſians,</hi> who are otherwiſe a free People; but they are forced to pay Him tribute, that ſo they may enjoy their Eſtates, lying within his Dominions, as alſo becauſe they are too neer Neighbours to him; which Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood alwaies inforceth the weaker to be a Servant to him that is ſtronger then he. By this Third kind of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> the King of Spain beareth rule over the <hi>Genueſes;</hi> becauſe that their Merchandiſe, and their Baronies lye within his Territories. And therefore I ſay, that that Prince, whoſe Dominions lye far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one from the other, ought in the firſt place to endeavour to joyn them together by a <hi>Natural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> and then Secondly by <hi>Political Bonds</hi> and <hi>Ties.</hi> As concerning <hi>Natural Ties,</hi> the King may by them joyn his Spaniards with any other Nations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the moſt part they are hated by all Nations; for, a Spaniard, whiles he is a Servant, is humble enough; but, where he is a Maſter, he is very proud. And he is, beſides, a great Boaſter, and Loves to deal very ſubtlely, and cunningly in meer trifling buſineſſes: though he does not carry himſelf ſo in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118554:67"/>of any Moment. It is alſo certain enough, that the Spaniſh Language and Habit doth pleaſe moſt people; but then again, their ordinary Carriage and Converſation, and their ſwelling Titles, together with their Ambitious ſtriving for the uppermoſt places at all meetings, and their too affected, ſtately Gate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſts every body. And becauſe theſe Vices are Naturally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in this Nation, although they caſt a blot upon their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, namely their Patience, Religion, Manlike Courage, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Eloquence; yet they cannot poſſibly be quite taken away; and therefore others muſt come over unto their Manners, as trees are graffed into one another. And therefore I ſay, it would be a very excellent good Courſe, if our Spaniſh Souldiers, and Barons, that live abroad in Forraign Countries, ſhould marry Wives out of the ſame: and beſides, thoſe Arts by which ſtrangers ſhould be invited in to match with Spaniſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and by Offices, (of which I have formerly ſpoken) deſerve ſo much the more ſerious Conſideration, becauſe there lies more within them, then they outwardly make ſhew of. And this will appear more clearly when I ſhall come to ſpeak of each ſeveral Nation in particular.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Political <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi> the King muſt endeavour to procure an Union betwixt his ow Nation and others; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Religion;</hi> which is the ſureſt means of uniting men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the World; and this muſt be done by the meanes of good, and Learned Preachers; as we have ſaid before. And next, by the Tye of New, and Famous Arts and Sciences, and Languages, which would draw all men into an admiration of ſo great an Empire. And let Him alwaies make war rather upon his Neighbouring Enemies, then upon thoſe that are farther off, and let Him go himſelf in perſon to the wars. And laſtly, let him perſwade, and invite all Nations that traffick into the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to take up their Commodities in ſome parts of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; as we ſee, that <hi>Genueſes</hi> do at this day. And therefore let Him ſo order all buſineſſes, as that one Kingdom may alwaies ſtand in need of another; that ſo by this means there may be a continual Tie betwixt them. And let him ſeek out all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ways of ſetting his enemies at variance amongſt themſelves, and labour that they may diſagree both in Religion, Leagues, Manners, Sciences, Conditions, Traffick, and all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and let him be in League with all thoſe that may do him
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118554:67"/>any hurt. All which things that they may appear the more clearly, I ſhall now fall to ſpeak Particularly of all ſuch ſeveral Nations, as may either annoy, or be advantageous to Him; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all laying down the means by which they may be brought to an Union with him. For it is an Undoubted Truth, that every great Empire, if it be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> within it ſelf, is ſo much the ſafer from the Enemies Incurſions, becauſe it is not only <hi>Great,</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> alſo; whence cheifly is derived all its ſtrength and Power.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O what hath been ſaid, we may further add, that ſeeing that there are ſo many ſeveral ſorts of people in Spain, the King ought to take care, that thoſe amongſt them, who have heretofore been more Eminent then the reſt, for the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Dominion they had there, be at Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among themſelves. And therefore let Him labour eſpecially that there may be all fair Correſpondence and friendſhip betwixt the <hi>Caſtilians, Arragonians,</hi> and the <hi>Portugues;</hi> and let Him confer equal Offices upon them in Court, and let him beſtow preferments upon the <hi>Portugues</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and upon the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal;</hi> &amp; alſo let him, as it were, tye them one to the other by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bond of Marriages betwixt each other, and by the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Navigation. And the ſame courſe alſo is neceſſary to be taken with the Mountainous <hi>Biſcaines,</hi> and the <hi>Lionois;</hi> and alſo betwixt the <hi>Aſtureans</hi> and <hi>Gallicians,</hi> and betwixt the Champian-inhabiting <hi>Andaluzians</hi> and <hi>Valentians:</hi> and let all theſe be brought to a familiarity one with another, notwithſtanding they are ſo far diſtant in place from one another.</p>
               <p>Let him alſo erect in theſe ſeveral Provinces, ſuch Common Colledges, and <hi>Seminaries</hi> for Souldiers, both for the Theorical, and Practical part of War, as we have before ſpoken, of that by means of theſe, both themſelves, and alſo the King may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the more ſecure: and let Him take ſuch order, that they may marry Wives from forraign Countries, and ſo may have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118554:68"/>Children by them; who, in caſe any War ſhould be made upon them, may fight for them, not as if by chance they were engaged thereto, but as they ſtand bound to do ſo by the Law of Nature. And by little and little their old Cuſtomes are alſo to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but not upon a ſuddain: and let them be inſtructed how to bear Offices in <hi>Italy,</hi> rather then in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> But in <hi>Spain,</hi> let <hi>Italians</hi> be put to bear Offices with the Spaniards. And ſeeing that <hi>Spain</hi> is the Principal Seat of the Whole Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, there ought in it to be all Vertues and Sciences in their prime, and height; namely Juſtice and Religion; that ſo others may the more readily be induced to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their pattern to walk by, and may ſuck in Their Manners, whom they ſee to live ſo well, and happily. But in caſe that They ſhould be of a Diſſolute Life, and of corrupt Manners, they would be abhorred by all Nations: not to ſay any thing, that in <hi>Gravity,</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of Manners, they ought to excell all others, becauſe they have an example amongſt them whence they may learn theſe Vertues.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place it is neceſſary that they be very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well in the times of Peace, as of War; in which Principle they muſt be inſtructed, and brought up, in the aforeſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, where they are taught to yield Obedience and Service to the King.</p>
               <p>And then, if the King ſhall approve himſelf to be a Good Souldier, and a Cheriſher of Valour, and Worth; He will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily thereby winne himſelf the Love, and Affections of all men. And let him be ſure withal to deal Faithfully and Juſtly with every one; for then, all his Subjects will readily, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully compoſe themſelves to the Example of His carriage and behaviour towards others.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe Caſtles, and ſtrong Holds, that lye next to <hi>France,</hi> be very well guarded, and furniſhed with all Neceſſaries; and likewiſe thoſe that are at <hi>Corrugna,</hi> and on the Northern Coaſt of Spain, looking toward <hi>England:</hi> and all care muſt be taken, that theſe be not ſet upon by the Enemy. But yet, the beſt way would be, to have a gallant Fleet, conſiſting of a Thouſand ſail, to be alwaies in readineſſe upon all Occaſions, as I ſhall ſhew by and by. Let the Spaniards alſo teach whatever <hi>Africans,</hi> or Weſt, or Eaſt-Indians, are either brought over to them, or elſe come over to them of their own accord, all Mechanical Arts
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118554:68"/>and Profeſſions; but let them ſtudy themſelves only <hi>Military Sciences;</hi> and let them indeed rather addict themſelves to theſe Studies, then to thoſe of Books: But as for all Forraigners, let them be put rather to the reading of Books, then the Practiſe of Armes. For we ſee, that the Learned City <hi>Athens</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in War by the Martial City <hi>Sparta:</hi> both which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were afterward reduced, and brought under the power and ſubjection of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> namely, becauſe this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been better inſtructed in the Uſe and Exerciſe of Arms, by their King, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, then either of thoſe Cities had been. It is ſufficient therefore, if the King have Seminaries for the Arts and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, for His new <hi>Auſtrian Order</hi> (before ſpoken of) to be brought up in, among his Forreign Subjects, and Nations; but as for others, there is no great care to be taken of them, but they may apply themſelves to the Study of Sciences and Arts, if they think fit: however, it is very neceſſary, that, in Spain, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as well in the ſaid Seminaries, as out of them, be brought up in the Exerciſe, and Knowledge of Armes.</p>
               <p>There ought alſo to be Schools erected for the Educating and Training up of the Younger Sons of the Spaniſh Nobility: whence the King may be furniſhed with Able and Faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, both for Land, and Sea ſervice: of which thing alſo we have ſaid ſomewhat before.</p>
               <p>Neither ought any Man to deſpiſe, or ſet light by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Spain, becauſe of the Barrenneſſe of it: for this defect is not to be imputed to the Nature of the Soyl, but onely to the Scarſity of people to manure it. For this Country is of a moſt fruitful Soyl of itſelf; and yeildeth plentifully all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that are neceſſary for the ſuſtaining of Mans life; and if it were but carefully manured, and tilled, it would be able to feed an infinite number of people: in like manner as heretofore it was able, beſides Its own Inhabitants, to feed alſo the vaſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> Neither did any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try longer, or more gallantly ſtand out againſt the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> then <hi>Spain</hi> did: neither had It ever any Army cut off, but it was able preſently to raiſe a greater.</p>
               <p>But to paſſe by Ancient Stories, it is reported by our Latter Writers, that the King of <hi>Granada</hi> brought into the Field, againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Fifty Thouſand Horſe; which number of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118554:69"/>Horſe, I doubt, would ſcarſely at this day be made up out of all the other Provinces beſides, both of Spain, and <hi>Portugal;</hi> not that either the Nature of theſe Countries, or the Temper of the Heavens, are changed; but only, becauſe that the number of the Inhabitants is grown leſſe, and ſo conſequently the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and tilling of the Ground is very much neglected now, more then heretofore. Now, the number of the Inhabitants is decreaſed, firſt by reaſon of that war with the <hi>Moors,</hi> where they got the better of the Spaniards; for, in that War, within the ſpace of three Months, there were ſlain Seven Hundred Thouſand Men. After this followed another war, which continued for the ſpace of Seven Hundred ſeventy and eight years; till ſuch time as the whole Nation of the <hi>Moors</hi> was utterly rooted out of Spain: in which ſpace of time there was a Vaſt, and indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible number of men ſlain on both ſides; inſomuch that many Cities, yea and many whole Large Tracts of Ground were left utterly deſert, and void of Inhabitants. And this War was ſcarſely ended, when preſently the Spaniards prepared for other New Wars again, ſetting upon <hi>Africk, Naples, Millan,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> and having overcome all theſe, they then ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to endeavour the Recovery of the Netherlands: in which Wars alſo there was a vaſt number of Men loſt, being cut off either by the War, or thoſe other Calamities, that are the uſual Conſequents of War. And then again, even now at this day they are continually ſending abroad infinite numbers of people into the aforeſaid <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> partly to make Plantations there, and partly to Traffick as Merchants there, or elſe to keep ſome Garriſons or other. And therefore the Practiſe of Husbandry hath been a long time neglected in <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe that the people of that Nation are naturally inclined to the Exerciſe of Armes, and ſo rather ſeek after Profit that way, by their Pay, as Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then by any other way whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And indeed the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is but a heavy, dull fellow, not onely at Agriculture, and Points of Husbandry, but generally at all Mechanical Arts whatſoever: and that is the reaſon that Spain is ſo unfurniſhed of Mechanicks, and that their Wooll, Silk, and what other Commodities the Country affords, are all tranſported abroad; and what ever courſe matter they do not ſend out, is in a manner all wrought up by the Italians onely; and as for their Fields, and Vineyards, they leave the manuring of them to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118554:69"/>the <hi>French.</hi> And if we would but diligently examine what the reaſon ſhould be, that Spain hath enjoyed a moſt quiet, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed Peace, for ſo long time together; whereas <hi>France</hi> is continually haraſſed and imbroyled in Wars, we ſhould find the Principal reaſon hereof to be this, namely, becauſe that Spain is continually imployed in ſome Forreign Wars, either in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in ſubduing ſome Hereticks or other, or in keeping off the Invaſions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> or of the <hi>Moors;</hi> in all which the Spaniards have both their hands, and Minds wholly imployed and ſet on work; mean while their Country continues quiet, and they themſelves vent all their venom of Sedition againſt others. And therefore I may not here omit to relate, how that many times, for want of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they have been forced to do, as the <hi>Finlanders</hi> are uſed to do; who, when they go out to fight againſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> are wont to carry along with them a great number of Fierce Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dogs, which alſo many times do them very good ſervice. Which very thing was alſo put in practiſe in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> by <hi>Vaſco Nugnez,</hi> not without much ſlaughter done upon thoſe Barbarians, many times alſo by this meanes putting them to flight. But we have already dwelt long enough up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Spain.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of</hi> Italy.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Pain hath no Nation, that is more a friend to It, then <hi>Italy.</hi> And therefore for the preſerving of the Amity and Friendſhip of the Italians, it is very fit, that the King of Spain ſhould ſo court and ply by Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Gifts both the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> and the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanois,</hi> as that other Nations ſeeing it, ſhould admire the Felicity of thoſe Two countries, &amp; ſhould withal wiſh, themſelve had the like good Fortune. And this the King may do, by remitting ſome thing of their Gabels and Taxes, &amp; by increaſing the number of Men in both thoſe Dominions; and He may alſo erect in both theſe Countries certain <hi>Seminaries,</hi> out of which, as out of the <hi>Trojan Horſe,</hi> may iſſue forth Able Perſons,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118554:70"/>that are skilled both in all the Liberal, and Military Sciences, and ſuch as are withal moſt firm, and reſolved Catholicks: as we have hinted before. Which thing would certainly cauſe in Forreigners both Admiration, and Aſtoniſhment; neither would the King (as the Opinion of ſome men herein is) loſe any thing at all thereby.</p>
               <p>Let there be alſo ſome courſe taken for the Reſtraining of Uſurers; and let Him ſet up ſome <hi>Monti della Pieta,</hi> as they call them; that is, <hi>Banks of Charity;</hi> which are certain publick Houſes, where the poorer ſort of Citizens have the liberty of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Mony upon their <hi>Pawns.</hi> Let them alſo reſtrain the grouth of the Nobility: and let the <hi>Barons</hi> Priſons be viſited ſometimes; for Theſe are many times too cruel. Neither would I have it in the power of any, to impriſon any man by any private Authority, except it be in Caſe of Sedition, or Violation of the Publick Peace, or of Treaſon againſt the Prince; and, thoſe that are Priſoners, ſhould be dealt more gently with, then they have been hitherto wont to be: for, the Kings Officers, by their Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Cruelty, have cauſed the King to be branded with that Infamous Name of a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> eſpecially in the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I conceive, it would make very much for the winning of the Love, and Good will of the common People, if the King would appoint One <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> at leaſt, who ſhould joyn to himſelf ſome of the Clergy, and ſhould go and viſit all the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Priſons,</hi> reforming what abuſes they find there: and ſhould alſo take an Account of all Uſurers, and of the Inferiour ſort of <hi>Publick Officers;</hi> as hath been touched before. I would alſo have him to ſhew mercy to ſuch as are Proſcribed, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht perſons, under the Pretenſe of ſending them into <hi>Africk:</hi> and I would really adviſe Him, once in ſeven years, to ſend all ſuch into the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for thoſe Souldiers, which have alwayes hitherto been ſet over the ſubjects, I would have them to be all disbanded; and in their ſtead, to have ſo much the greater Number of Gallies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that ſhould lye all along the Sea Coaſts throughout all the Kings Dominions, to guard, and ſecure them againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of the <hi>Turk.</hi> For theſe Souldiers have alwaies carried themſelves very Inſolently, and proudly towards the People; but have been ſtill very backward, and unwilling to go out in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118554:70"/>any Expedition by Sea againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> and beſides, when they have returned home from any ſuch Expedition, they have uſually abuſed poor Citizens, that have behaved themſelves ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fight, cudgelling them, and forcing from them ſuch priſoners as they had taken; and ſo afterwards in a <hi>Thraſonicall</hi> boaſting way, make their brags abroad that Themſelves had taken thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> priſoners: which moſt baſe, unworthy courſe we ſee practiſed in <hi>Calabria</hi> every day. It were a better way therefore, that the ſubjects themſelves ſhould take up Arms, and go out againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and ſhould have at leaſt half the Mony that the Priſoners taken in the War are valued at: for by this means the King will have both Valiant, and Rich men to Fight for Him: neither ſhall He have cauſe to fear, leaſt the ſubjects, through the hatred they bear the Souldiers for their Cruelties, ſhould ſeek to change their Maſters, and bring in ſome other to Rule over them.</p>
               <p>Let Him alſo take order for the reſtraining of the knaviſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Officers of the Kings Exchequer, who, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kings Right, forſooth, forbear not to uſe any manner of cruelty towards the poor ſubjects, impriſoning them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting mony from them, under any pretenſes, how unjuſt ſo ever. But of theſe evils, and their Remedies, we have ſpoken ſufficiently before, where we diſcourſed of <hi>Juſtice</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sea expeditions will render the King ſecure both from his Enemies abroad, and his own ſubjects at home; whereas, on the contrary, the Souldiers that are ſet over the Country people, do at firſt but very little good, and afterwards do none at all. And therefore the putting of good full Guards into all the ſtrong Holds upon the Sea Coaſt, will be ſufficient for the ſecuring of the Inland parts: and withall, the People will by this means be kept in a Loving Awfulneſſe, and Dread of their Prince.</p>
               <p>The beſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> that is to ſay, the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Duchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> is ſubject to the King of Spain: and thoſe other parts that are not ſo, are ſtirred up by their ſeveral Princes, who ſtand in fear of the Spaniards Potency, againſt the Spaniards, &amp; made to hate them: whence it is, that they are wont to threaten the King of Spain with two things. The firſt is, that they will call in the <hi>French,</hi> and encourage them to ſet upon the ſtate of <hi>Millan:</hi> which miſchief however the King might
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118554:71"/>eaſily prevent, if he would but place ſtrong Garriſons in all the Frontier Towns of the ſaid Duchy, and would quite deſtroy all the ſmall, unfortified Villages, that lying here and there ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, are made a Booty by the Enemy that hath liberty to range up and down where they pleaſe. And He might take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo, as the <hi>Hungarians</hi> do, that all the Proviſion of Corn, and all the ſubjects Goods be carried into the Fortified Cities, and Places of ſtrength, with all manner of Mechanical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that ſo thoſe that have fled thither in the time of any Siege or Incurſions of the Enemy, may have where withall to ſet themſelves on work, and may ſo get wherewith to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But <hi>Genoa</hi> lies very conveniently for the coming into the Kings Aſſiſtance; and ſo doth <hi>Naples</hi> alſo, if ſo be the King would but provide himſelf of ſuch a Fleet as I ſpake of before, to ly about thoſe Seas in a Readineſſe. For it is a moſt certain Truth, and that hath been confirmed by long experience, that He that can make himſelf Maſter of the Sea, ſhall give Lawes to the Continent, and command it; and ſhall be able to Land men whenſoever, and whereſoever he pleaſes, and ſhall find it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to do ſo: which the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould he be invited into <hi>Italy,</hi> could not be able to do.</p>
               <p>It will be a good courſe therefore for the King of Spain, to be in League with his Neighbours, the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and the <hi>Griſons;</hi> and let Him chuſe out of theſe Nations Thirty Thouſand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to whom He ſhall in the mean time allow half pay, till ſuch time as He ſhall have Occaſion to uſe them; according as the <hi>Venetians</hi> are wont to do; and this Army let him make uſe of for the repelling of any powerful Enemy aſſaulting him. But yet, leſt theſe people, encreaſing their numbers, ſhould themſelves invade the Duchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> which thing we know to have happened heretofore in the time of the <hi>Romans;</hi> I would have this Army to be divided, and ſome part of it to be ſent into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and another to <hi>Naples,</hi> and there may ſome of them alſo be ſent abroad as far as the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> that ſo, ſerving him abroad in His Wars, they may at length be all deſtroyed. And certainly ſhould this People but keep at home, and not go ſo much abroad to Wars, as they do, but ſhould unite their forces together; it would be a very eaſie matter for them to ſubdue all <hi>Italy:</hi> but now, whiles that they ſerve, ſome of them under this Prince, and ſome under that in their wars; there is no great
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118554:71"/>reaſon to fear any ſuch thing of them: However it would be a very good way, to divide them, as we have ſhewed, and to ſend them abroad ſeveral waies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, that the <hi>Italians</hi> are wont to threaten the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with, is, that perhaps They may enter into a League with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> to the Prejudice of <hi>Spain.</hi> But this conceipt of theirs alſo the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may eaſily elude: becauſe no one of them dares do any thing without the Pope and the King of <hi>France;</hi> as being not able of himſelf to defend himſelf; much leſſe to attempt any thing againſt others: unleſſe it be by chance, and by taking ſome extraordinary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; as the <hi>Venetians</hi> did heretofore, at what time the <hi>Popes</hi> were at War with the Emperours, and when the <hi>Tranſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi> made bold to march over into <hi>Italy.</hi> And therefore, if ſo be the King of Spain have but the Pope on his ſide, He hath no need at all to fear the Princes of <hi>Italy:</hi> neither indeed is there any Change made in any State, or Dominion in <hi>Italy,</hi> without the Pope; and, the Pope alone hath been the cauſe of all the Mutations that have happened in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> And in caſe the Pope ſhould take up Arms againſt any Party, or againſt any Common-Wealth in <hi>Italy;</hi> He would preſently prove the Conquerour; by having recourſe immediately to his wonted Helps; ſuch as are, His giving out <hi>Indulgences</hi> againſt it; and his abſolving the ſubjects from the Oathes they have taken to be true to the ſame; and by calling in others to His Aſſiſtance: as Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond did, at that time when He Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Venetians:</hi> at which time they were utterly cruſhed by him.</p>
               <p>Now my Counſel to the King of Spain is, that He would yeeld to the Pope, and do whatſoever He would have; and that He would give His Commands abroad as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour heretofore did; namely, that the Pope ſhall have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority in <hi>Laſt Appeals:</hi> and ſo likewiſe that Two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops with the King, who then holds the place of a Clergy man, be Judges in all cauſes that ſhall be devolved unto them by way of <hi>Laſt Appeals.</hi> And let it be agreed upon betwixt him and the Pope, that what Princes ſoever ſhall refuſe to ſubmit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they ſhall be deprived by their Authority.</p>
               <p>For if ſome of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> or indeed, if all of them ſhould fall off from the Pope: the King of Spain, who is the Vindicater of the Pontifical Authority, being aſſiſted by <hi>Croiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> and other Aides from the Pope, would by degrees ruin them
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118554:72"/>all, one after another, or elſe bring them in Subjection under himſelf; and thus, whiles he yields to the Pope,, He is ſure to have both His Affections ſurely united to Him, and His power aſſiſting him; and he ſhall withal make himſelf Maſter of the Princes of <hi>Italy's</hi> Dominions. And this may poſſibly hereafter come to paſſe; although, as matters now ſtand, all that the King can do, is, to make it his buſineſſe to keep theſe Princes at difference amongſt themſelves; and to make either the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> or ſome other of them, Sure to Him; and then He need care but little for any of the reſt. Let him alſo give the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> the Tittle of being <hi>The Fathers of Italy;</hi> and let him deſire of them the favour, to have ſome of the Principal of them ſent to him, whom he may imploy as <hi>Judges</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that this Nation doth more willingly admit of <hi>Italians</hi> then Spaniards; and, of all <hi>Italians,</hi> of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> rather then any other; and upon Theſe <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo imployed by him, let him confer the Dignities of Barons.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that it is known to every man, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are both very Juſt, and alſo free from Ambition, and ſo the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be made uſe of, if not for the gaining of any New Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, yet certainly for the keeping of what are already gotten; let the King ſo order the matter, as that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may be brought to deſire Lawes to be preſcribed them by the <hi>Venetians:</hi> of which I ſhall ſay more hereafter. And if by theſe Arts He could ſo far prevaile with them, as to get them to give over their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> to traffick there, and to take up a trade of Merchandiſe with thoſe in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi> have done; He would by this meanes in time make Himſelf Lord of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as He hath already of the <hi>Genoeſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that he may alſo ſecure himſelf in the mean time from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> it would be his beſt Courſe to provide himſelf of ſuch a Navy, as I ſpake of before; and He ſhould likewiſe do well to make uſe of the Archduke of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> and His Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Griſons</hi> in his wars; by this meanes to fright the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> the more. And beſides, let him give entertainment to all ſuch perſons as are baniſhed by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> or by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and receive them into his ſervice in his wars: and he may do well, to beſtow extraordinary rewards upon them too: that by this meanes he may draw others of them alſo over to him, who may ſerve under him, if neeed be, even againſt their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118554:72"/>owne Native Country: Which indeed was the frequent practiſe of the Duke of <hi>Millan:</hi> and alſo many times of the King of <hi>France,</hi> when for the ſame reaſon, he invited in to him all the Baniſhed <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> and <hi>Florentines.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon alſo the <hi>Strozza's, Piccolominies,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Peter de Medicis</hi> might in theſe our times ſtrike no ſmall terrour into the Great Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi>

               <p>If therefore the King would have theſe Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at variance among themſelves, let him take heed how he ſtrikes any fear into them: for, Fear is the onely meanes to unite them together: and therefore let him beware that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover not at all, that He is angry with them. Now there ought not any meanes to be uſed for the cauſing of any Diviſion amongſt them through differences in Religion: neither indeed can any ſuch thing poſſibly be effected: but this muſt be done only by beſtowing Rewards upon ſome of them; as we have ſaid before. And if any one of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſhould chance to be elected Pope, <hi>Italy</hi> were then quite undone.</p>
               <p>It would do very well alſo if the King would give way that Others might have liberty to come and Traffick at <hi>Genna,</hi> as His Subjects do: for, <hi>Genoa</hi> is, as it were, the King of Spain's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury: and He makes uſe of them, to keep the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in awe. And beſides, the <hi>Genois</hi> aſſiſt Him very much in poynt of Navigation, and Seafaring buſineſſes: as hath been ſaid before. But yet theſe <hi>Genois</hi> are to be treated handſomely, and cunningly: that they may not ſeem to be forced to do what they do, but only by Love, and Fair Uſage to be brought about to be ſo Serviceable, and Obedient to the King of Spain. Yet would I have the King pay his Debts to them as ſoon as might be: and he may either pawn, or elſe ſell them ſome few Townes, or Fortified Places; leaſt, if by chance there ſhould be any Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Riſing in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Genoiſes</hi> Banners might alſo march along with them for company. Let Him therefore continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have a Vigilant eye upon the two moſt Flouriſhing States of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Genueſes:</hi> yet of the two, the <hi>Vnetian</hi> doth far excell the <hi>Genuenſian,</hi> both in Dignity and Power. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> by maintaining a Free Trade of Merchandiſe with other Nations, have reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably well improved every man his own particular Eſtate, but have advanced the Publick infinitely; whereas the <hi>Genois,</hi> by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118554:73"/>being chiefely great Bankers, and Mony-Maſters, have infinitely enlarged their own Private Eſtates, but the Publick hath much ſuffered thereby. Which being conſidered, the King, in his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with theſe two different Commonwealths, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in a different manner.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and <hi>Sardinians,</hi> being both Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and alſo ſomewhat near Neighbours to <hi>Africk,</hi> ought, for theſe reaſons, to have ſtricter Lawes impoſed upon them, then the <hi>Italians:</hi> and a good way to keep them within the bounds of Obedience, would be, for the King to ſecure all their Havens, and Fortified places lying upon the Sea Coaſt. And theſe places would very eaſily be rendred ſecure, if the King had but ſuch a Navy continually in a readineſſe as I ſpake of before; which I would not have to lye all together in a body, but to be divided into ſeverall Squadrons, which ſhould lye round about <hi>Italy,</hi> and theſe Iſlands, and ſo keep them ſafe from all Invaſions of Enemies; the Souldiers of which Fleet, if they ſhould be ſet over the Countrymen, would do much more hurt then good; and beſides, the number of them muſt then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. Whereas by this meanes the Prizes that they take, from the Moors, and Turks, would be ſufficient to maintain them; and the King would alſo be thereby enriched, and the Coaſt of <hi>Affrick</hi> made ſafe and ſecure. And if it ſhould chance, that thoſe of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis</hi> ſhould at any time cauſe any tumult in favour of the Chriſtians, there ſhould be Souldiers alwaies in a readineſſe to come into their aſſiſtance, by ſayling over into the Kingdome of <hi>Oran:</hi> with which people they may Traffick, by carrying into them <hi>Silks, Wheat,</hi> and other Commodities, ſo long as the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea is Scoured and made Safe by the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians;</hi> ſo that there would be no need of fearing either the <hi>Turks,</hi> or Pirats.</p>
               <p>In theſe Iſlands there may very convenient <hi>Seminaries</hi> be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118554:73"/>erected for the breeding up of Souldiers, of ſuch Children, as with their Mothers ſhall be taken from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors;</hi> and in theſe may be alſo taught the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue; and there may be Monaſteries for Friers erected alſo, as we have hinted before. And here we are to give a Caution, that whenſoever any Merchants put in at either of theſe Iſlands, either from <hi>England, Turky,</hi> or <hi>Africk,</hi> there ought to be preſent ſome or other of the Clergy, leſt the inhabitants ſhould be infected with ſome Forreign Hereſy. For Iſlands, by reaſon of their Commodiouſneſſe for the reception of People of all ſorts, are very ſubject to ſuch Mutations and Changes; which is alſo obſerved by <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf. Thoſe that live near the Sea Coaſt, by reaſon of their ſo conſtant Converſation with Forreigners (for which reaſon <hi>Plato</hi> called the Sea the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of all Wickedneſſe) are Crafty, ſubtle, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and ſuch as know very well what belongs to Trading and Merchandiſe; But on the contrary, the Inlanders are ſincere, upright, and juſt, and content with a little.</p>
               <p>The King might alſo make very good uſe of Great Cities, ſuch as is Syracuſe in <hi>Sicily;</hi> which, as <hi>Cicero</hi> here tofore ſaid of it, had it been divided into four parts, would very well have made as many handſome Cities. And ſuch as at this day alſo is <hi>Palermo,</hi> in the ſame Iſland, which is adorned with State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Churches, and Palaces; wherein there are two things worthy to be taken notice of; the one is, a ſtately ſtreet, that runs all along the whole breadth of the City, and divides it in a manner into two parts, and is both very ſtreight, long, and broad, and withal adorned with very fair buildings; ſo that I do not know, whether all <hi>Italy</hi> can any where ſhew the like of it, or no: The other is, a vaſt <hi>Pile,</hi> or Banke, raiſed up by an infinite expence of mony againſt the Sea; by meanes whereof the City is accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with a very fair, capacious Haven: which is a work that is really worthy of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Magnificence. Iſlands, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, were, for the moſt part, the Neſts of Tyrants. But touching ſuch Havens as are neceſſary in caſe of ſuch fears, and likewiſe of Navigation, and Sea voyages, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in its proper place.</p>
               <p>And as concerning theſe Iſlanders, they ought not to be kept ſhort, and to be defrauded of things neceſſary; or to be held to too hard meat: but they have need rather, that ſuch Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118554:74"/>as lye lurking amongſt them; and alſo the Publick priſons ſhould be inquired into, and viſited; as we have ſaid before. There may alſo be erected ſome Seminaries for Sea-men; to which may be yearly ſent, in Gallies, young men to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Art of Navigation, as the Cuſtome is among the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and this the King ought to do ſo much the rather, becauſe that he wants young Seamen more then any thing: but yet to theſe he muſt joyn ſome Tranſalpine Seamen, for the encreaſing of his number.</p>
               <p>There may alſo be inſtituted in theſe Iſlands two New Orders of Knights, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Malta;</hi> neither ought the Revenewes belonging to the Knights that are of the Order of <hi>St James,</hi> or of any other Order of Knighthood, to be beſtowed upon Idle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that the King may not alwaies be forced to make uſe of Auxiliary Seamen; or elſe to imploy Mercenaries, ſuch as the <hi>Genois</hi> are.</p>
               <p>In ſuch Iſlands as theſe, the Barons ought to have a ſtricter hand held over them, then any others; becauſe that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the ſituation of ſuch places may tempt them to take an occaſion of Rebelling, here, rather then in any other places, theſe men being indeed Naturally inclined to be Rebells. And therefore the beſt way would be, to ſend Barons from out of ſome other Countries into theſe Iſlands; and of all other, thoſe of Spain are the fitteſt; the rather, becauſe they lye all in the ſame Climate: and theſe ſhould be put in truſt with all Offices, and Seafaring Affaires; with whom may be joyned ſome <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alpines,</hi> partly to aſſiſt them as Souldiers, and partly for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of Children. Neither ought any Noble men of the Natives to be intruſted with any of the ſtronger Holds, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: for theſe are moſt commonly the Authors and Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all Rebellions; as they have alwaies proved, againſt the <hi>French</hi> eſpecially; And yet theſe men have been ſince very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>Arragonians,</hi> by reaſon of their likeneſſe both in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Manners.</p>
               <p>In a word, there is nothing more Neceſſary for the making a Prince to reign happily, then that he throughly underſtand the Nature, Temper and Inclination of his Subjects. For, according as He finds theſe to be, ſo muſt He order his Government.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Omming now to ſpeak of ſuch Nations as are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſome of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding He hath ſome Title; the <hi>Germans</hi> firſt offer themſelves unto us; whom yet the King needs not fear, ſeeing that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is the moſt powerful in all <hi>Germany;</hi> being now raiſed up to ſo great a height of Greatneſſe and Power, by continual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with great Princes, and Hereditary Succeſſions, and great Alliances, as we ſee it at this day. For, <hi>Maximilian</hi> had the Provinces of the <hi>Lower Germany</hi> falling to him, by <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, who was daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> and <hi>Philip. Maximilians</hi> Son, became poſſeſſed of <hi>Spain,</hi> with all its Appurtenances, by the marriage of <hi>Joan,</hi> he daughter of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella;</hi> in which Kingdomes his Son <hi>Charles</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. And in theſe our daies King <hi>Philip,</hi> the moſt worthy Son of ſo worthy a Father, hath had <hi>Portugal</hi> with all its Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, which certainly are very great, fallen to Him by the death of his Mother <hi>Iſabella:</hi> from which very houſe is derived the Title of <hi>King of Both Spains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we are to underſtand, that the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is in league with none, ſave only Catholick Princes; ſuch as is the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with the <hi>German</hi> Archbiſhops, &amp; Biſhops and ſome few others: and therefore it is very neceſſary, that theſe ſhould ſtill be more and more cloſely united to each other, not only in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but alſo by Marriages into one anothers families, and other like ties and bonds, of Friendſhip: which as it is the Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt courſe that can be taken, ſo it is alſo the ſafeſt, and is much more firm and durable then any other whatſoever. But there muſt be all the care taken that may be, to ſow continually the ſeeds of diſcord and diſſention between the Marqueſſe of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Hoſſen,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> the Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and alſo the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and thoſe other Petty Common-wealths in <hi>Germany:</hi> which may eaſily be effected by reaſon of thoſe State Diviſions, and Emulations that frequently trouble theſe Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118554:75"/>and fill them with ſuſpicions, and Jealouſies of each other. And hence it comes to paſſe, that they never come in with their Aides to the Emperours, in any ſeaſonable time; Firſt, becauſe they conceive the Emperours buſineſſe, and deſign to be, to bring <hi>Hungary</hi> in ſubjection, not to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and then again, they are afraid leſt the Emperour, when he is now grown to ſo great a height of Power, ſhould endeavour to put a yoak upon their necks alſo, and keep them in ſubjection. And therefore they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him to be indeed the Head of their Union; but yet they will not yeeld Him any Homage; but themſelves order matters as they ſee cauſe among themſelves, both in reference to the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of old <hi>Lawes,</hi> and enacting New, as alſo in doing the like in matters of Religion: a ſufficient example whereof we have both in <hi>Norimberg, Spires, Straſbourg,</hi> and <hi>Frankford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall here add, that this Diſſenſion among the <hi>German</hi> Princes is in one reſpect Advantageous to the King of Spain; and in an other Prejudicial, as it uſually proveth to be in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all Forreign Powers. For, the <hi>Turk</hi> hath already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away <hi>Boſnia, Croatia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria:</hi> and it is to be feared, that poſſibly he may ſome time or other force his way even into <hi>Auſtria</hi> it ſelf alſo. And then, if <hi>Germany</hi> ſhould find it ſelf to ſuffer thus, under the Protection of this Houſe; poſſibly they may reject It, and elect ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick to be their Emperour: which certainly would prove to be the cauſe of many Greater Miſcheifs. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the King of Spain ought to labour as much as in him lies, to bring either the Emperour himſelf, or elſe his brother <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,</hi> to enter into a League with the Duke of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> or elſe with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and that they ſhould joyn all their force and ſtrength together, to ruin the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Emperour alſo to engage Himſelf faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both to the Proteſtant Princes, and Free Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that what places ſoever He ſhall take in, in his Wars, they ſhall be all reckoned as Parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Empire, and not be accounted as Additions to his Own Houſe only. Then again, I would have him, during the time of the War, to confer upon all ſuch perſons of Eminency, as ſhall be ſent to his aſſiſtance by the Free Cities, Lands, and Lordſhips, and the like Gratuities; by this means to oblige
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118554:75"/>them the more to His ſervice, rather then to that of their own Native Country: in like manner as <hi>Caeſar</hi> engaged His Army even againſt <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. But this muſt be the buſineſſe only of ſome one of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that ſhall be a Perſon both of great Valour, and Wiſedom; neither can any meaner man undertake it. And then, having conquered the <hi>Turks,</hi> He muſt next march with his Forces againſt <hi>Germany,</hi> calling in to his aſſiſtance ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo, and <hi>Italians.</hi> For, unleſſe He do ſo, there is ſome reaſon to fear, that the King of Spain may receive ſome prejudice thereby. He muſt therefore take care, and to the ſame end deal both with the Emperour, and the Pope, that the Right of Election of the Emperour may be put into the hands of ſuch only as are his Friends; ſuch as are the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Archduke; for otherwiſe, if it ſhould ſo chance, as that the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be elected Emperour, it would very much impede, and croſſe all his Deſigns. But what courſe there might be taken ſo to prevail with the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Party, as that they ſhould elect no other for Emperour, but only the King of Spain, I ſhall be ready to enform the Kings Majeſtie himſelf, when He ſhall pleaſe to give me Audience touching theſe things: but I ſhall forbear to ſet any thing of This here down in writing.</p>
               <p>If the King deſire to make Himſelf Lord of <hi>Germany,</hi> He muſt firſt neceſſarily get Himſelf to be elected Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> and having brought this about, He muſt then, under a pretenſe of making War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> march into <hi>Hungary;</hi> and ſo He may upon a ſudden fall upon the Proteſtants before they are aware, and while they dream not of any ſuch thing; and by this means he may be ſo much before hand with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Cities, as that they ſhall not have any time to provide themſelves to make any reſiſtance againſt Him: which Courſe was practiſed by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, with very good ſucceſſe. And then, let Him bring in New <hi>Colonies,</hi> and make New Laws, and place <hi>Italians</hi> over them, for his Miniſters of State; for the Clime will not bear the Temper of the Spaniard; neither can this thing be better ordered any other way.</p>
               <p>But indeed, the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Affaires go very ill, and They there have very much need of Aſſiſtance: For, if <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould be taken, the <hi>Turk</hi> might preſently march into <hi>Friuli,</hi> if he would.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118554:76"/>Now, what Courſes may be taken for the Prevention of this Miſchief, I ſhall hereafter declare, when I ſhall come to ſpeak of the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſtant Practiſe of the <hi>Turk</hi> hath been, in his Warres againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> never to maintain any long War with any one Prince: but to ſet now upon one, and then upon another; and to ſend ſome to invade one Country, and others to invade another, and ſo hath ſometimes ſnatcht away a whole Kingdom at a time from them. And leaſt, by being continually thus put to it, they ſhould ſo become to be expert in the uſe of Armes; He preſently makes either an abſolute Peace, or elſe agrees upon a Ceſſation of Armes with them, and then immediately falls aboard of ſome other, not giving them ſo much as any time to look about them, or to provide to make reſiſtance againſt Him: and then, having taken ſome City, or ſome Strong Hold from them. He preſently makes either a Peace, or a Truce with them, and ſo away again. By which means it comes to paſſe, that His Armies are all Old, Tried Souldiers; but Ours are, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part, made up of ſuch as are raw, and unexperienced in War. For, the <hi>Turk</hi> is continually at war with ſome or other; but ſo have not any of the aforeſaid Princes been. And hence it is, that He hath alwaies been of the gaining hand; and that, either by taking in, and adding to His Empire ſome new places; or elſe by eſtabliſhing to himſelf, and making ſure what He hath formerly gotten. But it is now time to return to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore again, that it behoves the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to take care, that His Friends be at Unity among themſelves, but that his enemies, eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> be at variance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and He muſt not let ſlip any Opportunity for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this about. And it would be a moſt excellent courſe, for the bringing down of the Hereticks courage, and taking them off their edge, if there ſhould be erected in <hi>Germany</hi> Schools for <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> that ſo by this means the Younger Heads might be buſied, and taken up with theſe kind of Speculations, rather then ſpend their time in Heretical Studies. And I would have others of them to be imployed in contriving of Engines for War, both by Land and Sea; and in other Mechanical Operations: and let the choiceſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118554:76"/>Wits amongſt them be invited, by large Salaries, to go into the Weſt-Indies, and there to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> But there is an Admirable way of cauſing a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt them, which pleaſeth me very much; and it is done two waies: the firſt is, if all deſire and willingneſſe of meeting one another, and laying their heads together to plot or deſign any thing be quite daſht in them: and this is to be done by fomenting what diſguſts, and Jealouſies there are amongſt them, ſo that one of them ſhall not dare to tell his minde to another, or to truſt any man with any of his ſecrets. And this was an Art that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great made uſe of; who alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides His Ordinary Tribunals, ſet up a Secret Court of Juſtice in <hi>Weſtphalin,</hi> for the keeping of the <hi>Weſtphalians</hi> in Order, who, after they had received Baptiſm, lived very ſtrangely neverther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; and not without ſuſpition of being falſe to the Chriſtian Faith. A ſecond way is, by hindring them from ever being able to do any thing, that may be Prejudicial to the State: and this may be done, by ſeeing that there be no Affinities, Leagues, or other Correſpondences contracted between the Principal and moſt powerful Perſons of that Nation; and Secondly, that no perſon that is, of any very Eminent Account amongſt them, be ſuffered to live there, but that he be removed ſome whether elſe. And this courſe did <hi>Charles</hi> the Great take, to avoid the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Combuſtions that aroſe in <hi>Saxony,</hi> by ſending away all the Nobility of that Province into <hi>France.</hi> Laſtly, let him be ſure to place in all their Councels, Colledges, and about all Magiſtrates, ſome of His Creatures, to ſerve him for Spies, and Informers.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that there is no Chriſtian Kingdome, that is more able to oppoſe, and put a ſtop to the growing of the <hi>Spaniſh Monarchy,</hi> then <hi>France</hi> is, (I ſpeak here of ſuch Kingdomes as are United, and lie compacted together all in a body) as being the greateſt, richeſt, and moſt Populous in Chriſtendome: for, it hath in it ſeven and twenty thouſand Pariſh Churches in it, and feedeth about a hundred and fifty Millions of Soules; and is ſo fruitful by Nature, and ſo rich, through the care and induſtry of its Inhabitants, that it comes behind no other Country whatſoever: Adde hereunto, that It lies not far from Spain; and the Inhabitants thereof do naturally hate a Spaniard; and are beſides excellent Souldiers, and have all but one Head over them, reſiding alſo in their own Country: all which Circumſtances you ſhall not find to meet in any one Country beſides: for ſome lye either very far off, as the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> do; or elſe are heartleſſe, and unapt for War, as are the <hi>Italians;</hi> or elſe are divided among themſelves, as the <hi>Germans</hi> are: All theſe things (I ſay) being conſidered, it will be needful that I ſhould here give a more exact, and punctual account of the <hi>French</hi> then ordinary; wherein alſo I ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, what, and how great Errours we have of late years commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in reference to them; that ſo for the future we may be the more wary, as to this Particular.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Nation, being deſcended from <hi>Japhet,</hi> by <hi>Gomer,</hi> by their ſtrength, and the force of their Armes, and having alſo their Religion, and the Fates Propitious to them, have had very great Succeſſes; in that under the Conduct of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and King <hi>Pepin,</hi> they arrived to ſo great a Monarchy, as they then had. And certainly all the other Princes of Chriſtendom had at that time an eye upon the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> and if the <hi>French</hi> had but cruſht the Impiety of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> when it was yet but in the Bud, they might eaſily have compaſſed the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118554:77"/>Monarchy of the whole World: and that ſo much the rather, by reaſon that their Rivals, the Spaniards were divided into Many ſeveral Kingdomes, and were beſides held in Play with the <hi>Moors,</hi> who had invaded their Country; ſo that at that time they were not at leaſure to interrupt the <hi>French,</hi> or to take them off from their Deſignes: as the <hi>French</hi> at this day hinder Them in theirs. But for as much as the <hi>French</hi> have not the skill of carrying a Moderate Hand in Government over ſuch Forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as are under their Subjection, but are too Impatient, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet; they could never yet attain to ſo great a height of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For they are apt to arrogate too much to themſelves; &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no gravity at all, they permit their Subjects to do what they pleaſe; and ſo ſometimes they uſe them too cruelly, and ſometimes again too gently; having no regard at all to their own defects, and weakneſſes. And hence it hath come to paſſe, that though they have gotten many things abroad, yet they have not been able to keep any of them. For, in One evening, they loſt all <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily:</hi> and almoſt in as ſhort a time, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> too, together with the Duchy of <hi>Millan:</hi> and for no other reaſon, but only becauſe that they knew not how, through want of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Governing, to oblige their Subjects to them by the Love of the Publick Good: nor yet took any care to draw in others to put themſelves under their Protection. For, when the people once perceaved, that there would be very litle or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them, in reſpect of their Liberty, whether they ſerved the <hi>French,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they would not vouchſafe ſo much as to draw a Sword in their behalf. And for the very ſame reaſon did the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Millan</hi> ſeveral times loſe their Dominion over the <hi>Genois.</hi> We may add hereto, in reference to the <hi>French,</hi> the Diſcord that was betwixt the Sons of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; becauſe that one of them would be King of <hi>Italy,</hi> another of <hi>Germany,</hi> and a third of <hi>France:</hi> and likewiſe the weakneſſe of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, who would needs all be free Princes, and live of themſelves without any Head: ſuch as are the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> of the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with diverſe others; each of which would needs be an Abſolute Prince of himſelf. So that as well for theſe Reaſons, and becauſe of their being dlvided in their <hi>Religion,</hi> and alſo as well by <hi>Fate,</hi> as by God himſelf,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118554:78"/>and beſides, by not laying hold upon Occaſion, when it was offered, they ſeem to be excluded from ever attaining to the Univerſal Monarchy of the whole World. And therefore the Majeſty of the Univerſal Dominion over all ſeemes rather to incline toward the Spaniards, both becauſe Fate it ſelf ſeemes to have deſtined the ſame unto Them; as alſo, becauſe it ſeemes, in ſome ſort, to be their Due, by reaſon of their Patience, and Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But becauſe that the very Situation of the Country, the manner of their Armes in War, and the natural Enmity that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>French</hi> and the Spaniards, ſeem to require that <hi>France</hi> ſhould be continually in War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhould be ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting their Glorious Proceedings; like as alſo when it was in a flouriſhing ſtate under <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, it was hindred by <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> and as it may alſo at this day be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Hereticks of <hi>France,</hi> and their King Henry the <hi>Fourth,</hi> who is a Valiant, and Warlick Perſon; theſe things, I ſay, being conſidered, it nearly concerns the King of Spain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider the ſtate of his own Affaires, and withal to weigh the Power of <hi>France;</hi> and to be ſure, when any fit Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered, to fall upon them with all his might, &amp; to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them on that part where they are Weakeſt, that ſo that other part, where they are more powerful, may ſink of it ſelf. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that they are weak, not in Armes, but in Wiſdom, and Brain; He ought to manage his War againſt them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And therefore, firſt of all, he muſt be ſure to lay hold on Fortune, and Opportunity, whenſoever they offer themſelves; as evidently appeares by the example of that good Fortune, that delivered the aforenamed King <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> into the hands, and power of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; by which means, had he purſued that Opportunity, he might have cruſhed all the Princes that were his Competitors; for he ought immediately to have bent his whole ſtrength againſt <hi>France,</hi> and by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Germans</hi> to have repreſſed, and curbed the Inſolency of the <hi>French.</hi> I ſay, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Germans:</hi> for they, as being the more Fierce Nation of the two, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been as an Antidote againſt the Fierceneſſe of the <hi>French.</hi> And hence it is, that the <hi>Franconians, Normans, Swedes, Gotlanders, Danes,</hi> and other Northern Forraign Nations, have alwaies, in a manner, been to hard for the <hi>French,</hi> that lye not ſo Northerly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118554:78"/>as they. And therefore, as I ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth ought immediately, with an Army of <hi>Germans,</hi> to have ſet upon <hi>France.</hi> And after that, he ſhould have put Guards of Spaniards into all their Caſtles, and ſtrong Holds, and ſhould have placed Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians in all their Courts of Judicature, and have appointed them to regulate their Lawes; and then ſhould either have brought <hi>France</hi> wholly under his own Power, and Obedience; or elſe ſhould have put it into the hands of ſome Petty Princes, to be governed by them; and ſo ſhould preſently have declared Himſelf <hi>Head of the Chriſtian World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he, inſtead of doing thus, had recourſe to that Vain, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe courſe of ſecuring himſelf, by marriage; chuſing rather to winne over to him his Rivall Neighbour by Fair meanes; which is never to be done, but with thoſe that are farther off; and which is eſpecially to be declined, when a Prince hath ſo Potent Neighbours that are his Antagoniſts for an Empire. For, the <hi>French</hi> had firſt a deſign of making themſelves Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Monarchs of the World, before the Spaniards had any ſuch thought; whom the <hi>French</hi> afterwards envied, when they found them aſpiring that way.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Opportunity of keeping <hi>France</hi> under in ſuch ſort, as that It ſhould not have been able to have oppoſed, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the growing Potency of the Spaniard, was offered to his Son, <hi>Philip,</hi> had he but had the skill to have laid hold of it, and to have made the right uſe of it. For, <hi>Henry</hi> the III. of <hi>France</hi> being ſlain by a certain <hi>Dominican</hi> Frier, under pretenſe of his favouring thoſe of the <hi>Religion;</hi> and the whole Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> being now divided into two Factions, namely, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> and many Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces having at that time the ſaid Provinces at their Devotion as, for example, <hi>Montmorency</hi> had that of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi> and others, had others: the Line of <hi>Valois</hi> being now quite extinct, and there being a great Controverſy ſtarted amongſt them, whether it were beſt for them to think of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any New King of ſome other Houſe, or not: and laſtly, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> being, by reaſon of his being an Heretick, hated by the Catholick Party; King <hi>Philip</hi> had at that time five <hi>Opportunities</hi> offered him: either of which had He but laid hold of, it would have been ſufficient to have made him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt to have weakned the power of it very
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118554:79"/>much; not to ſay any thing what might have been done, when all of them concurred, and met together.</p>
               <p>And yet to ſay truth, it lay not in his power at that time to effect this; for he ſaw, that if he ſhould fall upon this deſign in an open way of making war upon them, it would have been neceſſary for Him then to have had good ſtore of Souldiers to have brought into the Feild; (which at that time He had not,) to be able to divide, and diſtract all the Nobles of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to ſet them together by the ears. And therefore he ſhould firſt of all have dealt under hand either with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> or of <hi>Maine,</hi> or with ſome other of the moſt Powerful amongſt them, and have promiſed to make Him King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to make him His Son in Law: and at the ſame time to give hopes alſo to all the reſt of the Nobility, that they ſhould every man of them be made the Proprietary, and Abſolute Lord of their ſeveral Provinces; as that <hi>Montmorency</hi> ſhould have <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> confirmed to Him, <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſhould have <hi>Provence;</hi> and every one of them ſhould have had a promiſe made him of ſuch Lordſhips as they liked beſt; and all of theſe He ſhould alſo have furniſhed with mony, that they might have been the better enabled to make reſiſtance againſt <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navarre.</hi> He ought alſo to have entred into a League with the Pope, and the reſt of the Catholick Princes; that ſo joyning all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, they might all at once have ſet upon <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> who was of a different Religion from them.</p>
               <p>And then beſides all this, He ought to have obliged to him the hearts of all the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, and Preachers, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon them large Dignities, and Preferments. And when all theſe things had been thus ordered, then either the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon, or elſe, if He ſhould not think that fit, His Son, or the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> ſhould preſently have invaded <hi>France</hi> with an Army of at leaſt a Hundred Thouſand men, conſiſting of <hi>Germans, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and He ſhould alſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſent out ſome to make Excurſions into <hi>France,</hi> by the way of the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Country, and by <hi>Navarre;</hi> and <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all theſe things ſhould have been, with all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, put into Execution: which if they had, He had then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly done his buſineſſe, and had either added France to his other Dominions, or elſe might have Canton'd it out into many
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:118554:79"/>ſmall Baronies and Republicks, as <hi>Germany</hi> is; and ſo he ſhould have been ever after ſecure from their being able to do Him any hurt.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Philip</hi> was not nimble enough in his buſineſſe; and beſides, He was deluded by the French Nobles, who almoſt all went over to the King of <hi>Navarre:</hi> whereas, had He been but as quick as He ſhould have been, all this had never happened. For this is the uſual Courſe of the World, that every man looks firſt of all to his Own Intereſt, and then to that of the publick; and accordingly men uſe to beſtirr themſelves in troubleſome times.</p>
               <p>But here, in this caſe, where every one of them perceived, that the good of the Publick did conſiſt in the welfare of each Particular perſon, and ſo on the Contrary; they then preſently made choiſe of that which they conceived would be for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. And ſo, although thoſe <hi>French</hi> Nobles, being at the firſt by Mony, and fair Promiſes, wrought over to favour the King of Spain, and ſo were brought to enter into Action in order thereunto; yet when upon better Conſideration they found at laſt, that in caſe the Crown of France ſhould paſſe away to another, or that the Kingdom ſhould be parcell'd out into ſmall Dominions, and Republicks, the loſſe would at length redound to each of them in particular, whiles that the King of Spain might then with eaſe reduce them one by one, and bring them under his Obedience; ſeeing that they were ſo divided, as that they could not in any convenient time joyn their ſtrengths together to make any oppoſition againſt him; and beſides, knowing that France it ſelf, which had been hitherto ſo much honoured by all other Nations, would now come to be deſpiſed by them; and that all hopes of ever attaining to the Crown would now be quite cut off from them; and, that they ſhould afterwards find, that the Spaniards would but laugh at them for all their pains; they conceived it to be the ſafer, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Courſe for themſelves, to adhere to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> and receive him for their Prince. Which certainly when at the firſt, whiles they were inveagled, and blinded by the falſe hopes of the Spaniards Mony, they had not ſo well and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, as They did afterwards, when they had once weighed in their minds what the Event was like to be, and alſo ſaw with their eyes what the Kings Proceedings were; They
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118554:80"/>then at length began to elude Art with Art. Beſides, the French, perceiving alſo how great Inconveniences would ariſe, by maintaining a War with the Spaniard, did therefore the more willingly and chearfully proceed to the election of a New King, becauſe that they were perſwaded, that when a King was once choſen, thoſe evils would then be removed, which yet at the firſt they made litle account of.</p>
               <p>But the King of Spain committed yet another Errour in this Point, in that by his Slowneſſe He gave the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> time to make over to his Party the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Pope, only by making them believe, that He intended to abjure the Proteſtant Religion, and turn Catholick: beſides, that thoſe Princes did likewiſe conſider, that when <hi>France</hi> was once ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom they knew very well to gape ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly after an Univerſal Monarchy, their Own Turnes would probably have been next to have been ſwallowed up by them. This very Slowneſſe of his was the reaſon why the Spaniard gained the leſſe, and was alſo the longer held in expectation; and beſides, by gaping in this manner after what belonged to others, became hated by all: So true is that Common Saying; namely, <hi>That there is no place Inexpugnable, into which an Aſſe, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Gold, can but get in.</hi> But then this is alſo to be added to that Saying; namely, that <hi>That Golden Aſſe,</hi> or that Aſſe laden with Gold, <hi>muſt have many Horſes laden with Iron to come after it:</hi> that ſo while the Citizens are all buſied in weighing, and telling out their Mony, Thou mayeſt in the mean time make uſe of thy <hi>Iron</hi> in the ſubduing, and taking in of that Place.</p>
               <p>To this we may adde, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders, as well as the <hi>French,</hi> plaid booty, as we ſay; neither of them fighting for the Victory, but for Gain onely. And the reaſon of this was, becauſe that neither the King himſelf, nor his Son were preſent in perſon in the Army. And beſides the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> durſt not at firſt, in the beginning of the War, hazard all in a Battel, without Commands from the King; by which means the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had time given him to gain over to him the French Nobility, (whom the Spaniard had before wrought over by his Mony to His ſide,) only by an Opinion they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Military Valour. And in this He imitated thoſe other moſt Valiant Princes, who, neglecting the Common People, made it their only buſineſſe, to oblige the Nobles to them only:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118554:80"/>Which hath been the Ancient Cuſtome with the <hi>Polonians, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> And becauſe, that the Nobles think it a thing too much below them, to march with Foot Souldiers; hence it is, that theſe very Nations have alwaies been very ſtrong in <hi>Horſe;</hi> but have ſtill been but weak in <hi>Foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſeeing the buſineſſe is come to this paſſe, that the King of <hi>France</hi> hath now won to himſelf the Affections both of his Subjects, the <hi>French,</hi> and of the Pope alſo; and hath thereby got himſelf more Renown, then if he had beaten the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf; it is now to be feared, that He may ſometime or other attempt to take in ſome part of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo. For, He is of a Turbulent, Unquiet Spirit, neither can the <hi>French</hi> hold, while they have well ſettled a Country that they have newly taken in; but they muſt on ſtill, and fall upon ſome other; and this the King of <hi>France</hi> muſt the rather do, becauſe that being out of Mony, He is forced to forrage abroad, and take from others, that he may have to pay his own men. And therefore it will be neceſſary that the King of Spain take care that the Frontiers of Spain, and the Duchy of <hi>Millan</hi> alſo be well guarded, and fortified; and alſo, that he carefully obſerve theſe following Rules. The firſt whereof is, that he enter into a League with the <hi>French,</hi> who are his Competitors: and the Second is, that He hinder the coming of any Aſſiſtance to him either from <hi>England,</hi> or from <hi>Italy:</hi> both which things may be effected one and the ſame way; namely, if He do but perſwade the Pope, that the King of <hi>France</hi> hath a purpoſe of Aſſiſting the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and that, ſhould he but once come into <hi>Italy,</hi> he would ſcatter abroad the Poyſon of his Hereſie every where; and, that <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories will firſt be the Seat of the War, and afterwards will be his Prey. Let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> therefore deal with the Pope, that He would interdict the King of <hi>France</hi> the contracting of any League, or Friendſhip, either with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> or with any other of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; ſuch as are the <hi>Genevians, Helvetians,</hi> and <hi>Rhetians,</hi> or <hi>Griſons:</hi> for, theſe would be able to aſſiſt him very much. Let the Pope alſo make Him ſwear, that He will go to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and there joyn with the <hi>Italians</hi> in the Defence of the Chriſtian Faith. But the beſt courſe of all would be, that the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould all joyn together, and ſhould be ſent in an Expedition againſt <hi>Greece;</hi> and that there ſhould alſo be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118554:81"/>another Aſſociation made betwixt the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> againſt the Hereticks. For, if that the Chriſtian Princes were but thus diſperſed, and kept at a diſtance one from another, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> together with that of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duchy of <hi>Millan</hi> alſo, would have none to ſtand in fear of, but would be ſecure on all ſides: and beſides, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might in the mean time bethink himſelf what waies were the beſt to be taken for the reducing of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> over whom were he but once Conquerour, the forenamed Princes would be ſo much aſtoniſhed at the report of that his Victory, and of his Military Strength, that they would never dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt Him; no, though they ſhould return home Lords of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> For, although <hi>Pompey</hi> was a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet he was not able to ſtand againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that had now ſubdued the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces For, the <hi>Belgians,</hi> by reaſon of their Fierceneſſe in War, put <hi>Caeſar</hi> much more to it to ſubdue them, then thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> did <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was for this reaſon alſo inferiour to <hi>Caeſar</hi> in Power.</p>
               <p>Now in caſe that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth ſhould die, as he begins now to be an old man, and hath neither Succeſſor, nor Wife; or if he ſhould marry, and ſhould leave a Son behind him, yet probably he would be under Age; and ſo <hi>Conde</hi> would either be the next Heir to the Crown, or elſe would at leaſt have the Adminiſtration of the Government put into his hands, during the Minority of the Prince; whoſe Anceſtors, having alwaies been the Leaders, and indeed the ſtirrers up of the Hereticks of <hi>France</hi> in all their Wars, were the Authors of ſhedding ſo much Catholick blood: I ſay, ſhould things come to this paſſe, it would then concern the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to lay hold on that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, in propoſing to the Conſideration of the Catholicks of <hi>France,</hi> whether they thought would be the better courſe, to make choyce of <hi>Conde,</hi> or elſe of ſome Catholick to be their King; remembring that He is the Son of that Father, that acted ſo much <hi>Cruelty</hi> upon the Catholicks, which this Prince ſuckt in with his Nurſes Milk.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> muſt alſo ſo order the matter, as that if He cannot bring it about, that the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be divided in Judgment upon this particular, he muſt then deal with them, that it may be conferred upon ſome one that they ſhall pitch upon, by way of <hi>Election.</hi> Or elſe, in the laſt place, He
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118554:81"/>muſt ſpeedily have recourſe to the Arts before ſet down: which King <hi>Philip</hi> failed in before. And this manner of Electing a King, upon condition that he be a Catholick, would very much pleaſe the <hi>Italians;</hi> and the Catholick Princes of <hi>France</hi> alſo would very willingly aſſent thereto; becauſe that every one of them would have ſome hope hereby of attaining to the Crown himſelf. And if this ſhould once come to paſſe, it would prove a very great Weakning to the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> for, during the Vacancy of the Crown, there muſt needs ariſe very great, and long Diſſentions amongſt them; and, poſſibly, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo, being called in by ſome or other of the Princes, might come to have a finger in the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now for as much as Elective Kings are, for the moſt part, not much given to trouble themſelves about the enlarging the Bounds of their Kingdome; becauſe that they know very well, that their Sons are not their Succeſſours; therefore neither will they expoſe themſelves to danger upon the Account of another mans Intereſt. And this is the onely reaſon, why the Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> never trouble themſelves about the enlarging of their Empire; as neither do the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> unleſſe they chance to be Perſons of a high, Warlick Spirit, as King <hi>Steven</hi> was, ſurnamed <hi>Battorius;</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmund;</hi> both which maintained Wars with the <hi>Muſcovites, Tartarians,</hi> and others, about the Principality of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and ſome other Territories; becauſe they hoped, that their Sons ſhould at leaſt have ſucceeded them in thoſe. This Courſe is of very good uſe to a Prince, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of Military Glory, and through the Multitude of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the affection of his Souldiers, for the bringing his own Country under his ſubjection: which Courſe, I before ſhewed, was to be taken by the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> according to the Example of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, this piece of Craft being well underſtood by the French, hath been the cauſe, that they have now laid aſide all deſires of enlarging their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, meerly to avoid that Suſpition. And This Suſpition is the reaſon why the <hi>Venetians</hi> do not ſend Commanders of their Own into their Wars, but rather chuſe to make uſe of Forraign Commanders, whom a Little Mony contents well enough for their Pay. For, as to this particular, it was no ſmall hazard which they heretofore run, under <hi>Carmagnola,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus.</hi> And <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> who was but a Mercenary Souldier
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:118554:82"/>under the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> returning home a Conquerour, made himſelf Duke of <hi>Millun.</hi> For this very cauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hated the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> their Kings, who till that time had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been <hi>Elective:</hi> and this very thing alſo was the Ruine of the Duke of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that was Elected at <hi>Florence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are Opportunities at this time wanting of ſetting the French together by the ears among themſelves: for although their Peace is not at this time at all diſturbed by any Forraign Enemies; yet they being naturally of an Impatient, Unquiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are alwaies riſing up one againſt another, although it be perhaps but upon their quarrel about the Hereſie of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and I know not what <hi>New Gospel;</hi> which whereſoever it is preached, it bringeth, not Joy, but Mourning; not Peace, but horrid Wars; and filleth the Minds of Men, not with Good Will, but with rage and Madneſſe. This Miſchief therefore ought to be taken in due time, and have a ſtop put to it: for, this Contagion hath already infected above two hundred thouſand perſons in France For, if ſo be it ſhould ſpread further, and ſhould infect the Nobility alſo, and Peers of the Kingdom, it would be much to be feared, that there would never be any end of the Troubles of France: which is now the Condition of <hi>Germany,</hi> by means of the Dukes of <hi>Saxony, Heſſen,</hi> and others. For, as we ſee, ſuch Kingdomes as abound with Nobles, are made in a manner Immortal; as we may evidently perceive by the examples of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> For, when France was heretofore in a manner all ſubdued, and brought in ſubjection by the King of England; yet it was afterwards, through the Induſtry, and by the endeavours of the Nobility and Gentry, wholly aſſerted &amp; reſtored again to Its firſt, Natural Lord. And ſo likewiſe the Kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which is one while annoyed by the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and again another while by the <hi>Saracens:</hi> is yet ſo well defended by the <hi>Perſian Nobility,</hi> as that It is kept from falling under either of their Power, and Obedience. But yet, on the contrary ſide again, the very ſame Kingdomes are by reaſon of their Nobility alſo obnoxious to moſt unavoidable and miſerable Calamities; ſeeing they are able at any time either to aſſiſt, or protect all ſuch, as endeavour to introduce any Innovations, either in the State, or Religion.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy;</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have been a very great hinderance to the King of Spains deſigns that way: ſeveral examples whereof may be gathered from the proceedings of the aforeſaid Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> who appeared both againſt the Catholick King, in the Low-Countries, and againſt the moſt Chriſtian King in France, by fomenting the corrupt Humours in the ſubjects of both theſe Princes, and in aſſiſting the Hereticks both with her Counſels, and Forces. For they poſſeſſe an Iſland that is excellently well furniſhed both with Shipping, and Souldiers; and by this means they rob the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in all places in the North whereſoever he hath any thing; and alſo wander out abroad, as far as to the <hi>New World;</hi> where, although by reaſon of the Fortifications made upon the Sea Coaſt, they cannot lay the foundation of any Kingdome, yet do they do the Spaniards no ſmall harme there. For, that ſame famous Engliſhman, Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of <hi>Magellan,</hi> who had done the ſame before him, ſailed round about the whole World more then once; and it is not impoſſible, but that the Kingdom of <hi>Bacalaos,</hi> which lies ſomewhat near to the Engliſh, and is very convenient for them, by reaſon of the temperateneſſe of the Air, may be ſome time or other ſeazed upon by them. However it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could but once make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> He would quickly get to be ſole Monarch of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the greateſt part of the <hi>New World.</hi> But, ſeeing that He is not able to reduce this Iſland under His Obedience, becauſe that It is ſo exceeding ſtrong; by reaſon both of its Situation, and multitude of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who Naturally hate the Spaniard and are quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from them both in their Manners, and alſo their Religion; it will concern Him therefore to defend himſelf as well as he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118554:83"/>can, and to fortifie and ſet ſtrong Guards upon all ſuch places of His Dominions, as lye open to their Incurſions; leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Engliſh ſhould chance to ſeaze upon them. And ſuch are the Haven <hi>Corugna,</hi> and all the Sea Coaſt of <hi>Galicia, Leon, Biſcay,</hi> and all the Kingdomes that lie in the other Hemiſphere; as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. But this he muſt make his cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt buſineſſe, namely, to weaken the Power of the Engliſh: for the effecting of which deſign, it would be ſufficient, if He could but bring it about, that the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and the <hi>Freezlander</hi> ſhould with their Fleets fall upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces at Sea, as I ſhall by and by make it plainly appear.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing He is ſo far from doing this, that his own Navies are very often damaged by the Engliſh ſhips, the only Remedy that is left him is, to provide himſelf of ſome Vaſt Fleets of ſhips which ſhould lie at <hi>Corugna,</hi> and <hi>Liſbon,</hi> that when ever the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Fleet ſhall return from the <hi>Indies,</hi> they may ſerve as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys to It, and may bring it home ſafely: or elſe they may be ſent forth either againſt <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> and ſo may divert them from lying in wait for, and infeſting of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navies. And becauſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is to be Lord of the Seas, it is very neceſſary that He build himſelf many Wooden Cities, that is to ſay, great Navies, for the ſecuring of His Treaſure that he recieves out of the <hi>New World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would alſo be a very good courſe for him to hire thoſe that are of the greateſt ſtrength among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> though it coſt him a Million of mony, to guard ſuch Fleets of his, as are to paſſe to and fro in the Northern Seas; and to deal in the like manner with ſuch Nations, as are better skilled in Nautical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves are: as namely the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziokers,</hi> by means of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who is allied to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> likewiſe with the <hi>Gutlanders, Swedes, Finlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the reſt that are of <hi>Scandinavia, Denmark, Pomerania,</hi> and <hi>Boruſſia,</hi> procuring them to declare againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and either to ſet upon ſome of their Iſlands, or elſe to invade England it ſelf, that ſo they may divert them from falling upon the Spaniſh Fleets; or elſe, if the King ſhall think it better, to ſet upon the Engliſh Navy it ſelf. If, I ſay, He would but be at ſo great a charge, as to hire the ſaid Nations to fall upon the Engliſh, and would beſides but give them all the Booties that they ſhould take from the Engliſh, He might compaſſe all his deſires: and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118554:83"/>beſides, the ſeeds of ſuch a Feude once ſown, would ſpread far and near, and would never be killed and choaked again. And therefore I conceive, that Mony alone would be able to ſet theſe People at Variance, and make them fall foul one upon the other.</p>
               <p>And it is certain, that <hi>England</hi> ſtands in fear of no other Nations ſo much, as of thoſe above named: becauſe they are both more fierce, and more Populous Nations, and alſo more powerful at Sea, then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves are. For, <hi>Spain</hi> cannot it ſelf make any conſiderable oppoſition againſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> unleſſe it be by makig uſe of ſome ſuch Artifice; ſeeing that they are better acquainted with thoſe Northern Seas, then the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are. And then, <hi>England</hi> is an Iſland whoſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are both very Numerous, and they are alſo a diligent and ſubtle People; and it is beſides very ſtrongly fortified both by Sea and Land, and withall a deadly enemy to <hi>Spain,</hi> partly by reaſon of their different Religions, and partly becauſe the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> claime a kind of Right to that Crown, by reaſon of the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Line, which is derived by the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, diverſe of the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> of the Family of <hi>York,</hi> and others, have been allied to <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as concerning the weakning of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there can no better way poſſibly be found out, then by cauſing Diviſions, and Diſſentions among themſelves, and by continually keeping up the ſame; which will quickly furniſh the Spaniard with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more advantageous Opportunities. And as for the Religion of that People, it is that of <hi>Calvin;</hi> though very much Moderated, and not ſo rigid, and auſtere as it is at <hi>Geneva:</hi> which yet cannot ſo eaſily be extinguiſhed and rooted out there, unleſſe there were ſome certain Schooles ſet up in <hi>Flanders,</hi> (with which People the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have very great co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erce) by meanes of which there ſhould be ſcattered abroad the Seeds of Schiſme and Diviſions in the Natural Sciences; as namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Stoicks, Peripateticks,</hi> and <hi>Teleſians;</hi> by which the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> might be made manifeſt. For, the truth of it is, That Sect is Diametrically contrary to the Rules of Policy: for, they teach, that whether a Man do well, or ill, he doth all by Divine Impulſion; which <hi>Plato</hi> Demonſtrates, againſt <hi>Homer,</hi> to be oppoſite to all Sounder Policy; which ſayes, that every Man hath <hi>Free Liberty</hi> of <hi>Will,</hi> either to do
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118554:84"/>Well, or Ill; ſo that it is in our own Power, either to obſerve, or not obſerve what is commanded us; and from hence we are to expect either our Rewards, or Puniſhments; according as I have moſt evidently demonſtrated in my <hi>Dialogue</hi> touching <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi> where I have diſcourſed of this Point, though but briefly, and without any flouriſh of Language; which They, ſince they have become Hereticks, are grown ſomewhat ſubtle in: and yet, being of a Nature that is ſtill deſirous of Novelties, and Change, they are eaſily wrought over to any thing.</p>
               <p>As concerning their Dominions, and Private Eſtates, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh are divided, and live in ſeveral Countries: whence ſome time or other the Spaniard may eaſily light upon ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Opportunity of advantage againſt them. For the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Dominion is divided into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> which together with <hi>Scotland,</hi> maketh up the Iſle of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi> Now <hi>Scotland</hi> it ſelf hath alſo many ſmall Iſlands belonging to it, which are called the <hi>Orcades.</hi> And hence it is, that the Iſle of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> had alwaies two Kings reigning over it: namely, one of them was King of <hi>England;</hi> and the other, of <hi>Scotland;</hi> who, by reaſon of their lying ſo near to each other, were in a manner continually at wars, and invading one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Territories; for their Kingdomes are ſevered only by a little ſmall River, and ſome few hills. But now the King of Scots hovers, as it were, at this time over <hi>England,</hi> not only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Neighbourhood to it, but alſo becauſe of His Right, of Succeſſion; for His Mother was Niece to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who was Father to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and, if we ſhould confeſſe the truth, there is none ſo near in blood to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as He is. And therefore the time now draweth on, that after the death of the ſaid Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who is now very old, the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> muſt fall into the hands of their Ancient and continuall Rivals, the Scots.</p>
               <p>We may here add, that the Peers of the Land, who when they are aſſembled together in a Body, are called in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Parliament, carry a great ſway with them, and have very great Power: in ſo much that they ſeem to deſire to ſet up an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> or an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> State, according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhewed them by the <hi>Netherlanders.</hi> For, all <hi>Northern</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Naturally impatient of Monarchy, or Abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118554:84"/>in Princes; and the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were alwaies kept under by the Parliament; till that now of later times under pretext of introducing a New Religion, they have taken upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a more abſolute power over their Subjects. But in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Times the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was divided into four leſſer Kingdoms; as <hi>Spain</hi> alſo hath been anciently diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both into many ſeveral Kingdomes; both of which Countries did afterwards grow into two entire Kingdomes: although it cannot be denied, but that the Power of the Kings of England was never ſo great as that of the Kings of Spain.</p>
               <p>My opinion is therefore, that the King of Spain ſhould do well to employ under hand ſome certain Merchants of <hi>Florence,</hi> that are wiſe and ſubtle perſons, and that traffick at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who (becauſe they are not ſo much hated by the Engliſh, as the Spaniards are) ſhould treat with ſome ſuch of the Engliſh as are ſome way or other deſcended from ſome of the former Kings of England, and ſhould promiſe each of them ſeverally (no one of them knowing any thing what is ſaid to the other) all the poſſible aides that can be from Spain, for the reſtoring of them to their Inheritances, Legally deſcending down to them from their Anceſtours; and undertake to effect this for them, if not as to the whole Kingdome, yet at leaſt to ſome part of it: requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to engage themſelves to nothing elſe, (ſo to give a colour to the buſineſſe) ſave only that they ſhall not joyn their forces, and aſſiſt the Engliſh in ſetting upon the Spaniſh Fleet at its return from the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> For by this meanes each of them being puft up with hope, will preſently fall to queſtion the King of Scots his Title to the Engliſh Crown, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to oppoſe him in it. Let him alſo ſend privately to King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and promiſe him, that He will aſſiſt him to the utmoſt of his Power in his getting poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England, upon this condition; viz, that He ſhall either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore there again the Catholick Religion; for the love whereof, His Mother, <hi>Mary Stuart,</hi> Queen of Scots refuſed not to ſpend her deareſt blood, and even to lay down her Life too; or at leaſt, that he ſhall not annoy, or any way diſturbe the ſaid Spaniſh Fleet.</p>
               <p>But then again on the other ſide, let him under hand la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with the Engliſh Peers, and the chiefeſt of the Parliament, and egge them on to endeavour to reduce England into the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118554:85"/>Form of a <hi>Republick:</hi> withal aſſuring them, that the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> when he ſhall have once gotten into the Engliſh Throne, muſt needs prove a cruel Prince to them, as having alwaies about him a deep remembrance, how injuriouſly the Engliſh have heretofore dealt with the Scots. Moreover, let Him endeavour to ſtrike a terrour into Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> friends, by often put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into their heads, that they will find, that King <hi>James</hi> will revenge his Mothers blood upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> friends, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that She is like to leave behind her None of Her Own blood upon whom He might take revenge; eſpecially ſeeing that His Mother, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe was now to dye, ſeriouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto Him the care of the Catholick Religion, and the Revenge of Her Blood.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Biſhops are alſo to be exaſperated, and put into Fears and Jealouſies, by telling them, that the King of Scots turned Calviniſt out of hope, and deſire of the Engliſh Crown, and being alſo forced to do ſo by his Heretical Barons: but that, when He ſhall once be quietly ſettled in the Engliſh Throne; He will then quickly reſtore the Former Religion; for as much as, not onely His deceaſed Mother, but even the King of France alſo have both of them very earneſtly commended the ſame unto Him. By which means it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the ſeeds of a continual War betwixt England and Scotland will be ſown; in ſo much that neither Kingdome ſhall have any leiſure to work any diſturbance to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Affaires. Or elſe by buzzing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ears, that in caſe King <hi>James</hi> ſhould be poſſeſt of this Kingdom, He will however be a Friend of Spain: that the whole Iſland would be devided into many Dominions, or elſe that it would come to be an Elective Kingdom; (by which means the King of it will be the leſſe careful of making himſelf Maſter of other Countries, and of adding them to the Engliſh Crown; neither indeed, though he ſhould never ſo much deſire it, would he ever be able to do ſo, as I have before ſhewed, where I ſpeak of <hi>France:</hi>) or elſe, that this Country of England will be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Form of a Common Wealth, which will perpetually be at feude with Scotland; and that all Actions It ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, will be long in bringing to effect, and ſo It will be able to do the leſſe harm to Spain.</p>
               <p>The Spirits of the Engliſh Catholicks alſo are to be rouzed up, and, as it were, awakened from ſleep, and encouraged to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118554:85"/>Action: for by this means, ſo ſoon as ever the Throne ſhall be vacant, the King of Spain ſhall come into England, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of aſſiſting them. Let Him alſo deal with thoſe Engliſh Nobles, who are poſſeſſed of ſome certain circumjacent Iſlands lying about England, that they ſhould exerciſe an Abſolute and full Juriſdiction, each of them in their ſeveral places, and have Peculiar Courts of Juſtice of their own, diſtinct from thoſe of England: which very thing we read to have been Anciently done by them.</p>
               <p>The Chief of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility alſo are to be dealt with, that, as ſoon as they hear of the Queens death, they ſhould new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del <hi>Ireland</hi> either into the Form of a Republick, or elſe ſhould make it a Kingdom of it ſelf, throwing off all Obedience to the Engliſh; withal promiſing aides to each of them in particular: and that ſo much the rather, becauſe that in that Kingdome, or Iſland, the Catholicks, and eſpecially the Friers that are of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> are very greatly eſteemed and beloved. There is alſo much greater agreement and correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> then betwixt them and the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> whether it be by reaſon of the Similitude of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or elſe by reaſon of the Clime, and the nearneſſe of theſe two Countries one to the other. There are alſo in Ireland ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vagabond perſons, and ſuch as have fled their Countries, being men that are moſt impatient of Government; and yet are good Catholicks, and ſuch as may be able to do good ſervice in this kind, as hath been ſhewed already. But this ſort of Men is not very rare to be found, either in England, or Scotland alſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and the like Preparations may be made before hand; that, ſo ſoon as ever Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is dead, they may be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately put into Execution. For, there is no man but knowes what horrid Civil Wars, and what ſtrange Alterations, and Turns have happened ſeveral times in <hi>England.</hi> So that, what I have here propoſed, ought not to appear to any man, as things either New, or Impoſſible.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> is in Our time the moſt Potent of all the Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; inſomuch that, if it were not ſo divided in it ſelf, about Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it is; and were withal an <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Kingdome,</hi> and had a Prince that were a Native, and were not Elected out of ſome Forraign Nation, as their cuſtome is; it would prove a ſufficient Terrour to the <hi>Great Turk;</hi> eſpecially, if the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovia</hi> were but joyned with them. But the Nobility of that Nation, in whoſe Power the Election of the King is, are very much afraid of the King's Power; and for that reaſon They keep as hard a hand over Him, as poſſibly they can. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt endeavour as much as lies in Him, that no King be elected there, but ſuch a one as is of the Catholick Religion; which courſe hath hitherto been obſerved amongſt them. For, ſhould they chuſe themſelves a King that were of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, He would then very eaſily be induced to countenance, by his Authority, the Northern Hereticks; who do all agree in theſe two Points, (although they differ among themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all the reſt,) namely, that the Pope is <hi>Autichriſt;</hi> and, that the Arch-Dukes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> are all of them ſuch as fight for Antichriſt. And therefore, upon any the leaſt Occaſion that could be, they would be apt to joyn their forces together againſt both the Pope, and the Emperour, their Neighbour; had they but any Powerful Prince to head them, and to be their General: which Charge none is ſo able to undertake, and go through with, as the King of <hi>Poland</hi> is. For, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is but a weak Prince; and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> lies too far off; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is ſevered from <hi>Germany</hi> by the Sea.</p>
               <p>The King of Spain muſt then in the next place by all meanes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118554:86"/>endeavour, that one of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> may be advanced to the Crown of <hi>Poland:</hi> or at leaſt ſuch a one as is ſome way or other allied to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> as the now King of <hi>Poland</hi> is. And laſtly, he muſt be ſuch a one, as ſhall alwaies make head againſt the Turk, and that ſhould enter into an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who together ſhould to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour, as much as in them lies, the utter Ruine, and Extirpation of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He muſt alſo make choyce of ſome of the Wiſeſt, and moſt Eminent perſons of his Kingdom, whom He ſhall ſend as Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and who by their preſence may adde Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Weight to the Spaniſh Union, in the Eſteem of the Electors of Poland: and that may obtain of them, that in caſe the King of Spain ſhould have more Sons then one, that then They would Elect one of the Younger of them to be their King: for certainly, were any of the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Sons choſen King of <hi>Poland,</hi> He would never be ſo ſimple, and fooliſh, as to take upon him to govern the Kingdome of <hi>Poland</hi> according to his Own Will and pleaſure; as the King of <hi>France's</hi> Son endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do.</p>
               <p>Beſides, He muſt deal with the People of <hi>Scandia;</hi> and the <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> by the means of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who now is King of <hi>Swethland</hi> alſo, that they would joyn together, and ſend out a Fleet againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> as hath been ſaid before. For by taking this courſe, the Kings expenſe will not be half ſo great, as his Gains will be. He muſt alſo labour that the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> may in like manner enter into a league with the <hi>Polanders;</hi> or elſe, that either He, or the great Duke of <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> may be choſen King of Poland. For, ſeeing that theſe two Nations are not only Neighbours to the Turks, but do alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hate them, they might eaſily be able to ſtop his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And I am verily perſwaded, that among all the Northern Nations there is not any ſo fit, and able to oppoſe the Turk, as is the <hi>Muſcovite;</hi> who, would but the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> joyn with him, might be able to make Incurſions into the Turks Dominions, and march up even to the very Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Neither indeed hath <hi>Macedonia,</hi> or <hi>Moldavia,</hi> or <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> or <hi>Thrace</hi> ever ſuffered ſo much loſſe by any Nation, as by the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>

               <p>And if there were an Aſſociation contracted betwixt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> either by Marriage, or elſe by the nearer Tie of Religion, brought about there, by the Induſtry of the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> it muſt needs prove a very advantageous buſineſſe to Him: becauſe that <hi>Spaniſh Gold</hi> is, among theſe Northern Nations, of greater Eſtimation, and Account, then any thing elſe in the world. And then muſt the King of Spain be very careful, that, as ſoon as ever he finds he hath wrought up the affections of theſe people to a Willingneſſe to do him any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, He ſet them upon ſome Notable Expedition or other, while they are now ready for it, and before they begin to cool again, and repent themſelves of their forwardneſſe: For, <hi>Delay</hi> hath alwaies been the Ruine of the King of Spain's Affaires; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that his Confederates, through his ſlowneſſe in putting them in execution, have alwaies had time enough to ſmell out the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of His Deſigns; and by this means it comes to paſſe, that he commonly loſes his labour, and is at charge to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> alſo might be hired by the King of Spain's, and the Popes Mony, to joyn with the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> becauſe that They are in league with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Yet, when all is done, there cannot be any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matter done in this Particular, without the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Polanders</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Muſcovites:</hi> and unleſſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelf alſo be a Man of a ſtout, and Warlike ſpirit; (as we ſhewed before, when we ſpake of <hi>Germany,</hi>) and uſe his utmoſt endeavour to ſtop all growing Miſchieſs in their very Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; leaſt, by Delay, they get head, and grow ſo much the ſtronger, and Intractable.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not without good cauſe, that the King of Spain endeavours by all poſſible meanes that he can, to recover the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> again: about the keeping of that only part whereof, which he ſtill poſſeſſeth, it hath coſt him more Humane Blood, then there is Water in it; and about which He hath ſpent more Gold, then there are ſtones in it. And yet neither is this a matter ſo much to be wondred at; ſeeing that, could He but once make himſelf Maſter of thoſe Countries again, He might then very eaſily make himſelf Lord alſo of the Whole Earth. For, were this but done, both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> would quickly follow, in ſpite of what ever they could do: and alſo England it ſelf would be utterly ruined; and indeed all the Northern Nations would be much weakned, and rendred utterly unable to make any reſiſtance againſt Him. For we ſee that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> after he had once conquered the <hi>Belgians,</hi> made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account of all the reſt of the Northern Countries; and ſo preſently paſſed over into England. And indeed there is no power that lies more conveniently, and is better able to deſtroy the Engliſh Navy, then the power of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand:</hi> for theſe Provinces, both for the Number of their Shipping, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for their skill and experience in Nautical affairs, do infinitely ſurpaſſe all other Nations whatſoever: not to ſay any thing of the fierce nature, or of the Wealth of theſe People. For theſe <hi>Netherlanders</hi> have diverſe Towns and Cities, that are built in the very Water, after the manner as <hi>Venice</hi> is built: out of which Towns, they may very commodiouſly iſſue out, and fall upon the Engliſh upon all occaſions; and may be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Fleet, returning from the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and ſo may have opportunity of carrying over Colonies thither, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Plantations; and having ſubdued many Nations there, may exerciſe a free Trade of Merchandiſe in thoſe Countries. And therefore the King of Spain muſt endeavour, to the utmoſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:118554:88"/>of his power, to reduce theſe Countries, and bring them under his Obedience again; which yet ſeems now to be a buſineſſe of no ſmall Difficulty; and meerly through the heedleſneſſe, and Ill Managery of the Governours.</p>
               <p>I therefore conceive it would not be amiſſe, to reckon up here all the Errours that have been committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in this particular; that ſo they may learn to be the more wary for the future. And I ſhall alſo lay down ſuch ſubtle waies and means, by which theſe People may be ſubdued: For the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations are all of ſuch a ſpirit, as Naturally is addicted to a certain Licentious Freedome, and Liberty; in ſo much that no Prince ſhall ever be able to rule them by keeping a ſtrict, and ſevere hand over them, without uſing Politick Arts, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſomething of their Authority. For, theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by reaſon of their Natural Fecundity, are very numerous: now no Multitude, or Great Number, is eaſily kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>They are moreover of a firece diſpoſition; as being born, and brought up in a cold Clime. For, thoſe that are born in ſuch cold Countries, have their Natural Heat ſhut up cloſe within them, neither doth it in them Evaporate in ſmall, minute parts; whence it is, that they are full of Blood, Corpulent, and are full of ſpirits, and valiant; being alſo Lovers of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> rather then of <hi>Venus:</hi> and they are, by reaſon of the Natural Fuliginouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Miſtineſſe that is within them, full of unſetled, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Thoughts; and, by reaſon of their abundance of ſpirits, are very prone to all Licentiouſneſſe; being withall very ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and, by reaſon of their Drunkenneſſe, ſhewing little or no Gravity in their behaviour.</p>
               <p>Theſe Northern People (I do not here ſpeak of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that inhabit the utmoſt Borders of the North) are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over full of Courage, and without any Craft: whereas the Southern are, on the contrary, full of Craft and ſubtlety; but very fearful withal. The <hi>Northern</hi> People are of a Temper of Body ſutable to the Diſpoſition of their Mind; being big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied, and full of Fleſh; and are full of Blood, and Vigorous. But the <hi>Southern</hi> are on the contrary, Crafty, and have Dry Bodies; and are apter to run away, then to ſtand to it in a ſet battle. Thoſe former are of a Plain, Open Soul; theſe other are Wily and Subtle, and withal very Malicious; thoſe weare a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118554:88"/>Lions Skin; Theſe a Foxes: Thoſe are of a Boyſterous, and Inconſtant Nature; Theſe Slow, but Conſtant in their Actions: Thoſe are Merry, but Theſe are Melancholick; Thoſe are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Wine; Theſe to Women: Thoſe are Couragious; Theſe are Cowardly; Thoſe are Licentious; Theſe are more Compoſed.</p>
               <p>And therefore Theſe are to have more gentle and eaſie Laws impoſed upon them. for they are of ſo free, and looſe a courſe of life, as that they cannot endure to be bound in by Lawes; and beſides, relying upon their own ſtrength, they are apt to care little for thoſe that are their Lords and Rulers. All which things we find to be quite contrary, in the Southern Countries; and eſpecially in <hi>Spain,</hi> which lies ſomething near to the Tropick of <hi>Cancer;</hi> beyond which are the <hi>Amphiſcians,</hi> having their Noontide Shadowes caſt both wayes, at ſeveral times of the year. And therefore I ſay, that this was the reaſon why they were ſo eager to change their Religion; firſt, becauſe they are ſo addicted to Wine, and uſe to have ſo frequent Feaſtings, and Drinking-bouts: whereas the Rules of Religion require a more ſtrict life, with Faſtings and Abſtinence. And ſecondly, becauſe that being ſuch as are ſubject to Vehement, and unruly Paſſions, they had an Opinion, that they ſhould never be able to moderate themſelves in their Pleaſures. And this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they were ſo ready to give ear to the Doctrine of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> becauſe that theſe men deny, that Man hath Free Will to do either ill, or well; affirming moreover, that God himſelf doth work in men both good, and evil: which theſe Northern Men being eaſily perſwaded to believe, they conceive themſelves to have no power in themſelves, either to forbear Drinking, or to abſtain from Women. We may add hereto, that They have alſo longed to have an Opportunity given them of oppoſing the Pope, and the Princes, againſt whom <hi>Luther</hi> in his Sermons inveighed bitterly.</p>
               <p>Which Courſe of theirs was Diametrically Oppoſite to that which was taken in other Countries; where they eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, what ſtrange Troubles, and Tumults, the Introducing of a New Religion was the Cauſe of.</p>
               <p>Now the Hereſies, that ſprung up among thoſe of the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Countries, were full of Speculations, and had much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty in them; whereas, on the contrary, thoſe that were broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118554:89"/>among the <hi>Northern</hi> People, were very groſſe. For, ſome of the <hi>Southern</hi> denied the Divinity, ſome the Humanity, and ſome the Plurality of Wills in Chriſt; ſome of them again denied the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from the <hi>Word,</hi> and the like Points, that were both Sublime, and full of Myſtery. But the <hi>Northern</hi> Hereticks, paſſing by theſe High, and Subtile Fancies, fell to cry down the uſe of <hi>Faſting</hi> daies, <hi>Vigils, Penance,</hi> with <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> and all thoſe Points of Diſcipline, that hindred the Multiplication of <hi>Blood:</hi> to theſe we may add the Single Life of Clergy Men, and many other points of this kinde; which, though they agree with, and are very Conſonant both to Reaſon and to the Scriptures, are yet very repugnant to the Fleſh, and Humane Senſes. Theſe men alſo oppoſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſts Vicar: for, being Men of a high courage, they therefore ſtand ſtiffely to maintain their Liberty. And as in Temporall Matters, they are indeed under the Government of Republicks, or Elective Princes; and yet are no farther Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them, then they themſelves pleaſe; even ſo in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Matters alſo do they take to themſelves the ſame Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>And as among theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Nations their Commanders and Souldiers are more eminent for their ſtrength and courage, then for their Policy, and Stratagems; in like manner are their Miniſters, in their Diſputations, much better at Rayling then at Reaſoning. And hence it is, that under the Pretenſe of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, they only ſeek after Liberty of Dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and being accounted the only Men; which pleaſes them much better. And therefore the firſt Errour that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Spaniards in this Particular, was, that at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of <hi>Worms,</hi> and <hi>Auſburg, Luther</hi> was ſuffered to go away alive. Which although, as ſome are of Opinion, was done by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, out of a Politick conſideration; namely, that by this meanes the Pope might have ſome body that he ſhould alwaies ſtand in fear of, and ſo ſhould be forced to hold alwaies in with the Emperour, furniſhing him continually with Mony and Indulgencies, till ſuch time as He ſhould attain to an Univerſal Monarchy; and withal pronouncing all wars whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that He ſhould undertake, to be Juſt and Lawful: as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in caſe he ſhould not do theſe things, the Emperour might take part with his Antagoniſt <hi>Luther:</hi> yet the event
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118554:89"/>ſhewed clearly, that this was done againſt all the Rules of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. For the Pope being by this meanes weakned, the whole Chriſtian World is now thereby weakned alſo; and now that Hereſy is introduced, all Subjects, under the Pretenſe of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conſcience, have ſhaken off the Yoak of Obedience; an evident example whereof we have in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Low Countries, both which were Subject to the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> V. And therefore we may very well, and ſafely conclude from hence, that He was deceived, out of a certain Generous Pity; becauſe He doubted not, but that He ſhould be able to ſubdue not only <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Proteſtant Princes, but even the whole World alſo, whenſoever, and as often as himſelf pleaſed. Which Fancy of his deceived him in like manner in thoſe expeditions, that He made againſt <hi>Tunis,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> And therefore I ſay, that it was well done of Him indeed to keep his promiſe made to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſo long as the Diet laſted; But yet afterward, He ought not only to have diſpatched Him, in his return home; but to have proceeded to the utter extirpating alſo of the Proteſtant Princes. For, by this meanes, that Hereſy had been utterly cruſhed in the very Bud; neither ſhould <hi>Calvin,</hi> with ſo many others that have ſince infected both <hi>Germanies,</hi> ever have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World: neither had the Princes of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> ſo carefully followed the ſteps of the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> againſt the intereſt of <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>
               <p>A ſecond errour was commited by them in thoſe Parts that border upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> in that they believed, that they ſhould be able to bring in ſubjection, and order, that People, that had now ſhaken off the Yoak, only by taking the courſe that is uſed by the Spaniards; namely by introducing that Rigid Inquiſition, by the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> For we ſee, that Fires that are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by the ſtrength of the Winds blowing on them, increaſe rather the more, then are any whit put out by the ſame. When as therefore at the firſt theſe aforenamed People cryed out for Liberty of Conſcience, that ſo under this Pretenſe they might ſhake off the Yoak of Obedience; and that they could not at the firſt of all ſuppreſſe them either by Armes, or ſtrong Holds, or by their Lawes, that were yet accommodated to their own Natures and Temper: it was an eaſy matter for them to lay hold on their ſo much Beloved Liberty. And hence it was, that they divided themſelves into ſeveral Republicks, and choſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118554:90"/>themſelves Commanders, in order to a War to be made with the Spaniards: and ſo by this meanes it came to paſſe, that all the moſt Ingenious, and Valiant Perſons among them, had now an opportunity of ſhewing themſelves in the World, either in the Pulpit, or in the Field. Then preſently followed the Wars betwixt them and the Spaniard; whereby theſe People were ſo much exaſperated, as that they gave their Generals a greater Power then they had before; and therefore appointed Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to be General of all their Forces; who was a Man that was indeed more fearful then a Sheep, but more crafty then a Foxe: to whom his Son now ſucceeds, who is a Warlike young Man, and grown famous for his worthy Deeds, and Victories that he hath gotten. And theſe Princes, becauſe they profeſſed themſelves the Patrons of the Peoples Liberty only, were ſtrangely followed by them, and cryed up above meaſure. Then did they, to the end that they might make the People hate the Spaniards the more, bring in among them <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſme;</hi> by which meanes there was cauſed a greater Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt them and the Pope, and Spaniard, then is cauſed by the diverſity of Manners, ſhape of Body, and Diſpoſition of Mind that is betwixt them. For, the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> as hath been ſaid before, are white of Complexion, Tall, Licentious, great Drinkers, and Gluttons, Impatient, Indiſcreet, Sanguine, and of a free behaviour: whereas the Spaniards are Black, Crafty, Circumſpect, Sober, Continent, Patient, Diſcreet, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Covetous, Severe, and Grave, and (to ſay all in a word) contrary to them in all things. So that it ſeemes to be an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing, where there is ſo great a diſſimilitude, and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Manners and Temper of Body, to cauſe there any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Minds; which before was maintained betwixt them only by their being united both in Religion, and Government: which Union being now diſſolved, there was Neceſſarily to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Diſagreement, and Breach of all former Ties of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And hence it is now come to that paſſe, that the Low-Countrymen do more deteſt and abhor to be ſubject to the Spaniards, then they love their own life: and ſo likewiſe, on the other ſide, the Spaniards hate them worſe then the Divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: although they know how to conceal their hatred of them, better then the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> do theirs; yet in the mean time do they not omit to do them all the miſchief that poſſibly they can,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118554:90"/>that ſo they may make up their revenge full. Now the want of weighing, and conſidering rightly of theſe things, was the cauſe of the loſſe of theſe Provinces.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid it appears, that the King ſhould not have made ſo much haſt to have brought in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> amongſt them; neither ſhould He have put ſuch extraordinary Taxes upon them; or have affrighted them with the fear of War. But He ſhould rather upon the ſudden, and before they were aware of any ſuch thing, have clapt ſtrong Garriſons into all the great Cities, and all the Valianteſt, and moſt Eminent Men of any Seditious City, ſhould have been ſent abroad ſome whither elſe, under the Pretenſe of ſome Military Imployment; and the Ringleaders of all Hereſies were to have been extirpated and rooted out; and honeſt Preachers, choſen out among the Natives, and ſuch as were ſound in the Catholick Religion, ſhould have been ſubſtituted in their places: and then at laſt, after all this, ſhould the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> have been brought in, by the means of the Biſhops, though under ſome other name. And yet even then, He ſhould have forborn to have impoſed any Taxes upon them: that ſo it might appear to all the world, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their own Welfare and Good was ſought after, by Religion; and not the Kings Advantage, and Benefit onely. There ſhould alſo have been ſet over them ſuch Governours as were choſen either out of the <hi>Germans,</hi> or <hi>Italians;</hi> ſeeing they naturally abhor a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and theſe indeed ſhould be employed only in the keeping of Cities, but not be made Governours of them: for they are too Severe, and Ceremonious; whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould have ſuch Governours ſet over them, as are more Remiſſe, and Eaſie.</p>
               <p>To theſe Errours were added others, that were committed in the Managing of the War: for, the King himſelf, who was very much beloved of them, as being deſcended of <hi>German</hi> Blood, yet never went himſelf in perſon to the War, but ſent in his ſtead <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders, who were cruel by nature, and withal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hateful to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> being ſuch, as in their Commands would make uſe of Blowes rather, then of Fair Words. And the truth of this appeared, in that they deſired to have one of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to be their Head; and therefore made choyce of <hi>Matthias,</hi> the Arch-Duke. After him, they choſe one that was nearer unto them, namely <hi>Francis,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:118554:91"/>his ſon; who yet, having afterwards laid a plot ſo, as that upon a certain day appointed, he would have entered into the City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> upon a fudden, with all his Horſe, whileſt the Citizens dreamt of no ſuch thing, and would by this meanes have made himſelf Maſter of it; (but in the mean time having before-hand laid no foundation for this his deſign, neither by way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor Policy;) He was in an inſtant driven out again by the Tradeſmen and Merchants, and that not onely with the loſſe of his Reputation, and Principality, but ſo great was the Tumult, that He had like to have loſt his life in it too. And although <hi>Margaret,</hi> Arch-Ducheſſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was made Governeſſe of theſe Provinces for one while, and ruled there indeed with the Love and good Will of the Subjects; yet could She not by any means reduce the ſame into a due Obedience; becauſe that Hereſie had now taken ſo deep root amongſt them, and that the People had beſides a ſuſpition, that She had a Deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them, and bringing them again under the Obedience of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Scepter: and this was the Pretenſe, under which the Ringleaders of that Sedition amongſt them, covered their deſire of Principality, and Liberty, which they ſo greedily thirſted after. And yet afterwards God himſelf ſhewed a way by which theſe people might have been ſubdued; ſeeing that they were ſo divided by their ſeveral Sects, into divers parts; ſome of them ſtanding for dull <hi>Luther,</hi> others for ſubtile <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome again for diſſolute <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Mennon:</hi> in ſo much that you can hardly find a houſe amongſt them, wherein theſe different He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies are not maintained; neither are we wanting to our ſelves in any thing, ſave only that we have not the skill to lay hold on ſo wiſhed an Opportunity as this is, and to make the beſt uſe of it. For, every Kingdom that is divided within it ſelf ſhall be deſtroyed; and a firm Union hath alwaies a very hard Knot to tye.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding we have not yet ſucceeded all this while; not becauſe the Enemy doth do us any harm, but becauſe we annoy them. For it is certain, that by reaſon of their differences in Religion, they dare not one of them ſo much truſt another, as to joyn together in the Election of a General for their Wars: ſo that, if ever any where, it may be truly ſaid here, that, <hi>Quot capita, tot ſententiae,</hi> ſo may Men, ſo many minds. I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to ſpeak here, in reference to their Making of Warres
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118554:91"/>abroad for the enlarging of their Dominions. For, they are every one of them ſo Jealous, as that they cannot believe, but that, ſhould they proceed to the chuſing of ſuch a General to be over them, He would preſently take upon himſelf the Authority to extirpate all ſuch Sects of Religion, as are different from that which He profeſſeth: and it would be the general fear of them all, that ſuch a one would uſurp an Abſolute Power over them. And therefore we ſee, that the ſucceſſes which they have had in their Wars, under the Conduct of Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> have yet heartned them ſo far onely, as to enter into a League amongſt themſelves of maintaining a Defenſive War, but not of an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
               <p>And then in the laſt place, there be many other miſchiefs that lye in the way, to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from compaſſing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of theſe Provinces.</p>
               <p>The Firſt whereof is, becauſe they are to fight with an Enemy in his own Country; to whom both the Nature, and Site of the Country, and alſo the Temper of the Air are very agreeable; all which are moſt contrary to the temper of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second is, becauſe that this Nation underſtandeth very well, how great Inconveniences do ariſe unto them, by this their War with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and therefore it is not without good cauſe, that they do ſo hate the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are the Authors of this War: and certainly, to them,
<q>
                     <l>— <hi>Pax una triumphis</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Innumeris potior.</hi>—</l>
                  </q> A Firm Peace once ſettled betwixt them, would be infinitely more Advantageous, then all the Victories they ſhall get, be they never ſo many.</p>
               <p>A Third is, becauſe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being now, as it were, mad, that the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> have been able to hold them play, now for ſo many years together; ſhould they but once get the better of them, They would queſtionleſſe make a horrible ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongſt them: ſeeing that They do now at this time miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably afflict what Towns ſoever they take in, puniſhing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants moſt grievouſly.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Hinderance of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Succeſſe herein is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders fight onely ſo, as that they may have ſtill Occaſion to fight, and not that they may get the Victory; by this means making, as it were, a Trade of War;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118554:92"/>which ſhould be uſed rather as a Means, not only of Defending, but alſo of Enlarging their Dominions. And the very ſame is the Practiſe of the Commanders of the other ſide alſo: for even Count <hi>Maurice</hi> himſelf, to the end that He may the longer keep that Power he hath in his hands, and that conquering the Country by degrees, he may at length get into his power the whole Principality of it, protracts the War, and ſpins it out as long as he can: and His footſteps do the reſt of the Officers and Commanders diligently follow.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders prolong the War, that ſo their Pay, as well as their Authority may alſo be prolonged; and take the ſame courſe here, that <hi>Charles Spinola</hi> took, when he was ſent into <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> againſt <hi>Mark Sciarra;</hi> with whom he dallied only, and had no deſire to deſtroy him: that ſo the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> might leave Him to be as it were Lord of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and might alſo ſend him thoſe large Summes which he had promiſed him for his Service; mean while that <hi>Sciarra</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo ſent him vaſt Preſents, to the end He ſhould not fall too hard upon him. And thus <hi>Spinola</hi> being paid on both ſides, (both by his friend, and his enemy) continued for a long time, and without any danger, the Lord of that Country. So that it is no wonder, that King <hi>Philip</hi> having ſpent ſuch vaſt Summes of Mony in this War with the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> hath yet not only done no good upon it, but hath beſides exaſperated the enemy ſo much the more, and cauſed them to be the more exerciſed and experienced in Martial Affairs, and hath given an Opportunity to his Antagoniſt, Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders, of acquiring to themſelves great Fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown for their Military Proweſſe: and hath now brought the buſineſſe to that paſſe, that his enemies, though never ſo much divided among themſelves in their Religion, do yet, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through fear of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> continue faithful and Conſtant to the League that it made betwixt them.</p>
               <p>And therefore truly I am of Opinion, that this War which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> now maintaines againſt the <hi>Hollander,</hi> is both more Diſadvantageous to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and on the other ſide, more Advantageous to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (only becauſe they are thus continually forced to be in arms,) then if they were let alone, and ſuffered to live quietly. For thus we find it teſtified by <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and after him by <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> that the <hi>Romans,</hi> by being
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118554:92"/>continually exerciſed, and vexed with War, by their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, became by this means more eminent and glorious every day then other; and by the Tyranny of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and others, they grew thereby more and more united among themſelves: whereas on the contrary, when they were once left to themſelves, without any to annoy them, they then preſently fell to raiſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars amongſt themſelves. For when that <hi>Cartharge</hi> was once laid flat with the ground, and that the whole World was now conquered by them; being thus freed from all fear of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, through a Mutual Emulation amongſt themſelves they became preſently to be divided into Factions, and by this means brought deſtruction both upon themſelves, and their Common-Wealth; as we ſee clearly in the examples of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius;</hi> and of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> So true an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wiſedom is it, not to hold your Neighbours in War too long, leſt by that means they come to be Skilful and Valiant Souldiers. For thus heretofore it was objected againſt <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> who had been wounded by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> namely, that He had received but his due Reward from them, for teaching them, by His making a long War upon them, how to uſe Arms.</p>
               <p>But the cheifeſt point of Wiſedome is, for a Prince not to make War upon his ſubjects; eſpecially if they be his Natural ſubjects, and Natives. For by this means they will be but the more exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, and more Averſe from Him: and ſo, that which was at firſt but only a little Heart-burning, as it were, breaks out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward into open Rebellion: as we ſee it happened to <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> in his War that He made againſt the <hi>Bohemians.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you will never meet with any People, that are ſo utterly devoyd of all ſhame, as preſently, and upon the Inſtant to riſe and take up arms againſt their Prince; ſeeing that the very Name of Treachery and Rebellion is infamous, and hatefull every where. But when that the Princes ſword is once ſtained with the ſubjects blood, and that the Tye of Protection is now broken, and all care of Juſtice thrown aſide; they uſe then openly to fall off from him, and to declare themſelves his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> beginning at laſt to be weary of the long War he had maintained againſt them, wherein he had deſtroyed at leaſt fifty thouſand men; and asking ſome of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118554:93"/>his friends by what meanes there might be a firm and happy Peace concluded upon betwitxt them, was anſwered; that this could not be brought about by any other meanes, then by His Death: and thus did He, though too late, do that which He ought indeed to have done at the firſt. I could here reckon up many other examples to this purpoſe, but that I have reſolved not to tranſgreſſe againſt the Brevity which I at firſt propoſed to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore to my purpoſe, I ſhall here lay down for an Obſervation, that thoſe that are put to fight in their own Country, for their Wives and Children, <hi>pro Aris et Focis,</hi> as the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were uſed to ſay, are alwaies wont to fight more ſtoutly, then thoſe that make war upon a forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for, that Aſſault which is not ſucceſſeful the firſt day, growes by degrees weaker ever after, and withal adds the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courage to thoſe that are aſſaulted. For, the aſſailants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides thoſe other Inconveniences that Naturally accompanie all War, which certainly are very great, are alſo wearied out by the Diſagreeableneſſe of a ſtrange Air, and Soyl. Which thing, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had underſtood, or conſidered, and had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his firſt Victory at <hi>Trebia,</hi> marched againſt <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and had beſieged It; he might at that time eaſily have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: Or at leaſt, after his Victorie at <hi>Cannae,</hi> which was much the greater, He ſhould not have given the <hi>Romans</hi> any time to gather together freſh Forces; but, following the Counſel of <hi>Maherbal,</hi> ſhould preſently have ſet upon <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Thus <hi>Abſalon</hi> alſo, if he had followed the Counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and had at the firſt purſued his Father <hi>David;</hi> he had utterly deſtroyed him, and had poſſeſſed himſelf of all <hi>Judaea;</hi> neither had he given him any time to have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forces together, and to have recovered courage, as he did, to his Deſtruction. The Enemy is therefore either at firſt to be preſently ſuppreſſed, that ſo he may not get time, and gather ſtrength; or elſe he is ſome way or other to be drawn forth of his own Country; in like manner as <hi>Hercules</hi> drew forth <hi>Antaeus,</hi> King of <hi>Libya,</hi> that ſo He might the eaſier diſpoſſeſſe him of his Throne: For otherwiſe, the nearer he came to the ground, that is, to his own Country, the ſtronger he preſently grew: as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fable informes us. So that it ſeemes to be both a vain, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd undertaking, to maintain a war ſtill with the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:118554:93"/>in their own Country, ſeeing that they could not be conquered at the very beginning of the war: for the war doth but onely increaſe their ſtrength, and makes them abler to reſiſt. And therefore I conceive, that there are but two waies left now to be taken, for the bringing this buſineſſe to effect; the firſt of which is to ſow the ſeeds of Diviſion amongſt them; and the ſecond, To draw them forth out of their own Country. <hi>Cadmus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſigne of erecting a Monarchy at <hi>Thebes,</hi> whether he came a ſtranger, is ſaid firſt to kill a Serpent; by which was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Defence, and Safeguard of <hi>Thebes:</hi> and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to ſow the Teeth of it; that is to ſay, to ſcatter abroad the Poyſon of Deſire of Innovation, and an Earneſtneſſe to be inſtructed in the knowledge of learning, namely, in ſuch New Sciences and Arts, as he had brought over with him from his own Country. And hence Souldiers are ſaid to ſpring up, who through mutual diſcord ſlew each other; and the remainders of them that were left, joyned themſelves with <hi>Cadmus,</hi> their Head, and Captain; ſo laying the foundation of the Kingdom of <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Boeotia.</hi> I affirm therefore, that theſe very Courſes ought to have been taken by the King of Spain; and not a war to have been onely maintained againſt them all this while.</p>
               <p>And certainly if the <hi>Southern</hi> People would ever conquer, or lay the foundations of a Monarchy over the <hi>Northern,</hi> ſeeing that they are not ſtrong enough to bring the ſame about, they ought to have recourſe to the Arts either of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Jaſon:</hi> although of the two, <hi>Jaſon</hi> went the more wiſely to work; ſeeing he firſt wonne the heart of <hi>Medea,</hi> that is, the good will and Affections of the <hi>Northern</hi> Women to him: for, the Women of thoſe Countries are eaſily brought to love <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Men, by reaſon of the Natural Heat that is in them, which thoſe Women like very well: neither indeed do the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders</hi> hate the Spaniards ſo much, as their Wives love them. Afterwards <hi>Jaſon,</hi> by the enchantments of <hi>Medea,</hi> ſlew the Dragon, that is, the Guard of the Kingdom; ſuch as are the Warlick and Valiant men of a Nation, with the Preachers. And then did he by the meanes of enchanted Oyntments tame fierce Beaſts, the Brazen-footed, and fire-ſpitting Bulls; that is, by his Friendſhip and Gifts, He won over to him the Nobles, and Principal men of the Kingdom. And at length, by them he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118554:94"/>ſowed about the Teeth of the Dragon; that is, by the aſſiſtance of the Nobles, he ſpread abroad the Seeds of Diſcord and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention about Religion, Arts, and Honours. Whence in the laſt place ſprung up Souldiers, that is, <hi>Factions;</hi> (ſuch as are thoſe of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines,</hi> the <hi>Pontificians</hi> and <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and Catholicks,) wherein they killed each other: But thoſe that remained, choſe <hi>Jaſon</hi> for their Head, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and, though few in number, yet afforded Him their aſſiſtance in the getting of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch an Empire as we here ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>This Learned Fable I have therefore propoſed, and explained, that I might ſhew the King of <hi>Spain</hi> what he is to do; ſeeing that He hath hitherto taken ſo great pains, and loſt ſo many men, and all to no purpoſe; as <hi>Cadmus</hi> did, before he had killed the <hi>Serpent.</hi> Namely, in the firſt place, I would have either the King himſelf, or elſe his Daughter, or his ſon, to go and dwell either a <hi>Antwerp,</hi> or <hi>Bruxels;</hi> or, if he think fit rather, at <hi>Gaunt;</hi> that ſo, by their Preſence, the Subjects may be the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and withal Forraigners may be drawn thither too; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in following the Example of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> who, after his men were ſlain, went himſelf to the Fountain of the <hi>Sarpent,</hi> that kept the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I would have Him remove from all the Neighbouring Provinces all Suſpition, or fear of having any more Wars made upon them by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and He ſhould ſuffer them to live a while in peace, and quietneſſe: and He withal ſhew himſelf ſo gentle, and full of humanity to his own Subjects there, that Forreigners, taking notice of it, ſhould even repine thereat, and ſhould have a deſire kindled within them of enjoying the ſame happineſſe, and of joyning themſelves with His Subjects in the defending of that his Dominion.</p>
               <p>In the Third place, He ſhould remit the Taxes and Impoſitions that have been laid upon thoſe Places that are under his ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and ſhould exact no more of them, then what is neceſſary for the Maintenance of the Kings Court only, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Souldiers that keep the Garriſons there: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, inſtead thereof, He ſhould require a certain number of Souldiers to be raiſed yearly out of every City; which He may ſend away into the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> And let him be ſure to pick out the ſtouteſt, and ableſt men, for this purpoſe; by this means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118554:94"/>the Noxious Humours from hence, and turning them another way; and filling up with theſe men his Armies in other Parts. For, from all ſuch Countries as abound in Men, it is better to require Men, then Mony: for, this is both more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Prince; and alſo more agreeable to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the People themſelves.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I would have Him make a General Feaſt every year, to be kept upon one certain day, in each ſeveral City and great Town, and at His own charge; at which time every City throughout the whole Province would Voluntarily declare their readineſſe to ſerve the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And at this Yearly Feaſt I would have no coſt to be ſpared: for, there is nothing in the world that doth more unite this People among themſelves, and bind them to others, then to Feaſt them, and make them Drunk once a year at leaſt: which Practiſe is ſaid to have been firſt taken up by <hi>Minos,</hi> the ancient Law-giver.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I would have the Name of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> taken away; though the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> it ſelf ſhould be kept up by the Biſhops, but under ſome other Name; and It ſhould not be ſo ſevere, as it is in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at <hi>Rome;</hi> but the Terrour of it ſhould conſiſt in Words only, and Threatnings, rather then in any more Harſh Uſage.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that under pretenſe of a <hi>Croyſade</hi> Expedition, there ſhould be Indulgences, and Diſpenſations procured from the Pope concerning <hi>Faſting daies,</hi> and the Abſtaining from Fleſh at certain times of the Year: for, theſe People are infinitely given to Feaſtings, and Revellings.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, all Garriſon'd Towns ſhould be kept by <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers; but the Government of the ſame ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the care of Biſhops; as the Government of the ſeveral Provinces ſhould be put into the hands of Cardinals; who ſhould be ſuch as are of Ripe Years, and are eminent alſo for Wiſdom. And then would I have ſome of the Gentry of <hi>Venice</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as Judges, and to have the hearing of all Law Cauſes amongſt them: for by this means the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Low-Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> will eaſily be reconciled to each other; ſeeing that theſe later love the <hi>Italians</hi> much better then they do the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, let Souldiers be tempted by large Pay to leave the ſervice of the Rebel <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> and theſe ſhould be ſent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:118554:95"/>away to the King's other Armies abroad; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould do well to inveagle, and fetch away Women out of Their Quarters into their own; where they ſhould be married to <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And I would alſo have Women of Quality from among the Dutch Hereticks to be choſen out, and married to ſome of the Catholick Nobility: for, as I have ſhewed before, theſe Women would willingly yeild to love ſuch Husbands. And indeed it is a wonderful thing to imagine, how Advantageous a matter it is to ſuch Princes, as have conquered any Nations, to have their Subjects contract Marriages with the Women of the ſaid Nations. For, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great himſelf marrying <hi>Roxane,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> Lady, and giving to others of his Army a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other women of the ſame Nation for Wives, got Himſelf a great deal of good Will among the <hi>Perſians;</hi> who hereupon perſwaded themſelves, that they ſhould find <hi>Alexander</hi> a very courteous and loving Prince to them. And <hi>Livy</hi> writes of thoſe of <hi>Capua,</hi> that nothing did more hinder them from joyning with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> then the Affinity that had been contracted betwixt them and the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, let Him endeavour to weaken the Heads of their Factions, by making War upon them from ſeveral parts at once, and let all diligent care be uſed, that they may be more diſtracted every day then other, and divided among themſelves: that ſo through their own diſſentions, and their envy at the mutual Concord and Proſperity of their Enemies, they may even deſpond, and loſe all heart and courage. And this courſe, of making your own Advantages out of your Enemies Sufferings, is a moſt uſeful one, and was very much practiſed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, ſeeing that it is only the fear they have of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and eſpecially the hatred they bear to the Pope, that keeps them at Unity among themſelves; becauſe they do all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree in this, that the Pope is <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> though in all other of their Tenets they are at ſufficient difference among themſelves; there muſt therefore care be taken, that all fear of War being removed, That Controverſie only be propoſed to be publickly diſputed on; for, upon this do all the reſt depend. Neither would I have any other Nice, or Frivolous Queſtions to be at all propoſed to them to be diſcuſſed; but only that one, Touching the <hi>Novelty</hi> of the <hi>Papal Authority;</hi> as I have touched
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118554:95"/>before, and whereof I treated ſufficiently, in my <hi>Dialogue</hi> againſt Theſe Men.</p>
               <p>In the Eleventh place, it muſt be Unanimouſly, and ſtoutly maintained againſt them, that All Commentaries whatſoever that have been written upon the Bible, whether by Catholicks, or Hereticks, ever ſince S. <hi>Auguſtin's</hi> time, are to be ſuſpected, and not to be truſted to; and that the only Authors that are to be received, are S. <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> For, the Hereſie of <hi>Denying Free Will,</hi> and the like, are to be better underſtood out of the Ancients, (to whom alſo theſe people are moſt of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted) then out of Later Writers, (whom they cannot endure to hear of:) as appears plainly out of <hi>Clemens Romanus.</hi> I would have that controverſie therefore to be diſcuſſed, touching the Original of that <hi>Evil,</hi> that moved <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and ſome others, to deny that there was a <hi>God:</hi> for, they perſwaded themſelves, that <hi>He</hi> was excluded, by reaſon of <hi>Evil.</hi> Others there were, that believed there were <hi>Two Gods;</hi> of which number were <hi>Manes,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Pythagoras</hi> too. Others, as the <hi>Libertines,</hi> have boldly declared that their Opinion was, that there was no ſuch thing, as either <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Sin.</hi> Others have taught, that God is the <hi>Authour,</hi> and Cauſe of all <hi>Evil;</hi> and that he is a Tyrant: and of this Opinion are <hi>Calvin, Zuinglius, Bullinger, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Beza;</hi> namely, while they will have <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>Authour of All Things.</hi> Which Opinion certainly, as both <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> teach, muſt needs tend to the diſturbance of every Well Ordered Common-Wealth, for as much as it deprives Men of all Freedom of doing either well, or ill; and ſo in effect deſtroyes all Law and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. And the long Canvaſing, and dwelling upon the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Opinion, hath made all thoſe on the other ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> Atheiſts, and <hi>Epicureans;</hi> who have therefore denied that there is a God, becauſe they would not aſſent to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore my judgement is, that in diſputing with theſe men in the preſence of Learned men, they ſhould have Political, and Natural Arguments urged againſt them: And again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Common People, they ſhould be required to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whence they had their Calling: as I have ſhewed more at large in my <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and my <hi>Political and Theological Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,</hi> written againſt Theſe Men. For, the Multiplying of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118554:96"/>Books, and the Spinning out of Controverſies, do but add Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to a Bad Cauſe, and beſides alſo ſhew like a kind of Victory.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, theſe Hereticks after they had put forth New Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles into the World, and wreſting all the Fathers and Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as they pleaſed, put ſuch interpretations upon the ſame as they thought good; they then began, in order thereunto, to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of the Hebrew, and Greek Tongues, and ſtarted a thouſand Grammatical Niceties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have filled up many great Volumes: in ſo much that the whole North in a manner makes a <hi>Grammatical</hi> War upon us, rather then a <hi>Spiritual:</hi> whereas We have long ſince laid aſide the ſtudy of the Languages, ever ſince we overcame the <hi>Hebrews, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and have made them ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſtianity, or elſe have deveſted them of the power of diſcharging all Political, and Sacerdotal Adminiſtrations; as it is with the <hi>Jewes</hi> at this day. And therefore we intend not now to trouble our ſelves any further with Petite Sophiſtical Niceties, and Grammatical Quirks; but relying only upon our own ſtrength of Wit, we let alone all Prolixe Courſes of Diſciplines, and the tediouſneſſe of writing huge Volumes: mean while that theſe men ſpend their time herein, and we ary us out almoſt with their Cavillings, although they do not get the better of us.</p>
               <p>I conceive therefore, that theſe men ſhould be taken off from theſe their Grammatical Hereſies, namely by ſome New Arts and Sciences, and ſuch wherein we are excellent our ſelves. And to this end the King ſhould erect certain Schools in all the Principal Cities, wherein the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue ſhould be taught; that ſo by this meanes there may be ſuch among his ſubjects as ſhall be able to diſpute with the <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who by the uſe of that Tongue ſpread their <hi>Mahumetaniſme,</hi> as We do <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue: and ſo by this meanes our Inteſtine Wars may be laid aſide, and our Armes turned againſt Forreign Enemies.</p>
               <p>There ſhould alſo Schools be erected for the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> unto which theſe Northern People ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come, by propoſing ſome Salaries for ſuch of them, as ſhall apply themſelves to the Diſcovering, and giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch Stars, and Conſtellations, as are found in the other
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118554:96"/>Hemiſphere, in the <hi>New World.</hi> For, by this means there would redound to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Empire both Honour, and Profit. I would alſo have the Schools of the Old Philoſophers to be opened again; as of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and of the <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins;</hi> that ſo the People may be diverted from Theological Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and may apply themſelves to ſtudy Queſtions of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi> for, theſe come nearer to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> then the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtoſtle</hi> doth. Now the King, in doing theſe things ſhall follow the Example of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who, to the end He might the more eaſily overcome <hi>Antaeus,</hi> drew him forth of his own Territories; and alſo of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> who brought over New Arts and Sciences with him into <hi>Boeotia;</hi> and by means of the ſame, got to be Prince of that Country. And by taking this Courſe, the Principal among the Hereticks, when they ſhall ſee there is more to be gotten there then here, forſaking their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, will become Ringleaders in the Sects of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And beſides, that they may gain our favour, they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably make head againſt their enemies the <hi>Turks,</hi> and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Doctrine, which hath inſenſibly crept into <hi>Germany;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it agrees very much with <hi>Calviniſme.</hi> There ſhould alſo be erected Publick Work-houſes, for the exerciſe of <hi>Mechanical Arts,</hi> to which this People is exceeding Apt; and ſo by this means will the Buſineſſe of Navigation be much promoted, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the skill of Beſieging Towns, and of taking them in by the uſe of Artificial Fire-works. By this means the People (probably) will be taken off from their Falſe Religion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one from another; to the great Advantage of the King, and Kingdom of <hi>Spain;</hi> to whom many will now come and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Service; and His Empire, which of late hath been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and hateful to all the World, ſhall recover its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Splendour and Honour.</p>
               <p n="13">13. There muſt mutual Contentions and Hatred be ſtirred up amongſt the Nobles, and Principal Men of the Country: and that part, that moſt favours the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, muſt be aſſiſted, and rewarded with gifts; that ſo the reſt may be brought over too, and may be encouraged to do the like. But if this cannot be done, He muſt then rid them out of the way; or if they cannot be found to have deſerved death any way, then muſt their Reputation only be diminiſhed, (for Injuſtice
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118554:97"/>never yet took deep root) or elſe they muſt be ſent away into ſome other parts. <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> that he might leave <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> in a quiet and peaceable condition, perſwaded all the Principal of the Nobility to take their wives and children, and go live in <hi>Italy.</hi> And <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, to prevent the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Tumults and Commotions that were in <hi>Saxony,</hi> ſent all the Nobility of that Country into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. They ſhould be prevailed with to ſail away into the New World, and to joyn with the Portugal Fleet, and break into <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> through the Red Sea, ſo to annoy the Turks, as ſhall be hereafter ſhewed: that ſo being drawn out of their own Country to fight againſt Forreign Enemies, they may be deſtroyed by the Spaniards, who in this particular are much abler men then They.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The ſeeds of Emulation, and Envy ſhould be ſowed amongſt them, that after the example of thoſe Brothers that ſprung up out of the Serpents Teeth, they may deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that thoſe few of them that ſhall remain, may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made uſe of by the King of Spain, for his ſervice. But then it is neceſſary, in the firſt place, that the Serpent of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf. I mean Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed; and not have Opportunity given him, by the continuing of the War, of growing greater and more powerful every day then other. But before all, as I ſaid before, there muſt be New Learning, and New Languages introduced amongſt them, according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Cadmus;</hi> and there muſt likewiſe Women be got away from them, after the example of <hi>Jaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are to be hired every year, (though it ſhould Coſt the King a Million of Gold) to be a convoy to the Spaniſh Fleet returning out of the <hi>Weſt Indies;</hi> and alſo to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Sea Coaſt of Spain againſt the Engliſh; and thoſe that are the Chief amongſt them in that expedition, ſhould deliver up their Sons for Hoſtages, till ſuch time as they ſhall have done their buſineſſe effectually. For theſe men will willingly be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for mony, to fight againſt England: and very probably there will at length be found ſome one or other of them, that will for mony alſo betray even <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf, and their whole Fleet, to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And certainly, if the ſeeds of Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Envy, were but once ſowed among the Principal men, and Nobles of theſe Common-Wealths; they would never be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:118554:97"/>able to hold up ſo ſtifly againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and gain ſtrength every day, as they do: neither would thoſe, that now maintain Bookiſh Controverſies againſt the Pope, get ſo much reputation and Authority among the People: and the King himſelf would alſo by this means confirm his own Empire both by Sea, and Land, and would draw theſe People over to him.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Theſe People are wonderfully taken with <hi>Miracles,</hi> and are great Admirers of any Excellency, and Eminent Vertue: ſo that any Holy, and Wiſe men, might eaſily by their Arts draw them to any thing. Therefore there is need of ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Workmen, who by their Doctrine, and Spotleſſe Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Life, may call home thoſe ſtraying ſheep to the way of Truth. And if it ſhould pleaſe God to call Me to take this Imployment upon me, I ſhould &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="18">18. When theſe People were now once divided, and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they ſhould then upon the ſudden be ſet upon by an Army: for Delay tends rather to the confounding, then the well Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Affaires: For,

                     <l>—<hi>Semper nocuit differre paratis.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>When Preparations now are made,</l>
                     <l>Deſigns are by Delay betray'd.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The King ſhould therefore fall in upon them with a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and powerful Army, in the head whereof Himſelf ſhould be, and ſhould withal make uſe of ſome unuſual Stratagem; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all his Deſigns will come to nothing. There ſhould alſo ſome one among the Spaniſh Commanders, who is both a Stout, and alſo a Wiſe and circumſpect man, be ſuborned by the King of Spain, to counterfeit himſelf to be a Renegado, and going over to the Enemy, ſhould inſinuate himſelf into the States General, and ſhould prevail with them to make him their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: as we read <hi>Zopyrus</hi> did, who betrayed the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whether he had fled, (having firſt cut off his own Noſe, Ears, and Lips, and making them believe, that all thoſe were the Marks of the Cruelty of <hi>Darius</hi>) to his Maſter: or, as <hi>Sinon</hi> did to the <hi>Trojans;</hi> and as <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> did, who going over to the <hi>Gabii,</hi> and making them believe that he was fled from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and being both believed by them, and alſo choſen to be their General, he firſt cut off the chief men of the Common-Wealth, and afterwards betrayed the ſaid <hi>Gabii</hi> to his Father.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118554:98"/>For the bringing about of the like Deſigne whereof, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath need of a man that is moſt faithful, as well as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and Wiſe; and not ſuch a one as was that Perſidious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Antonio Perez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Seing that the Cities of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were in former times, and before the Wars, the greateſt Mart Towns in all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and that for no other reaſon, but only becauſe that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of all ſuch Commodities as were either imported thither, or exported into other parts (which were both infinite in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of all ſorts) were but ſmall: it will therefore concern the King, whiles He endeavours to reconcile theſe People to Himſelf, to take this into his conſideration, and to recall again that Ancient Cuſtome, and, in a word, to reſtore to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands its former Happineſſe, and to endeavour the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the ſame. For, although theſe Countries have no Gold Mines of their own, yet, while all things were quiet with them, and no noyſe of war heard amongſt them; what by their various, and ineſtimable Pieces of Workmanſhip, and their admirable skill in Manufactures, and other Arts, they had got together ſo much Gold, as that they needed not at all to envy either the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> or the <hi>Tranſſylvanian</hi> Mines: Neither was there any Country more Glorious, rich, or more frequented by Forreigners, I will not ſay, in all Europe onely, but in the whole World, then this was; in ſo much that, in regard of that vaſt, immenſe Treaſure, that <hi>Charles</hi> the V. received from thence, it was for juſt cauſe called by ſome, <hi>The Emperours Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It much concerns the Intereſt therefore of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that He reconcile theſe People to Himſelf, and that things may be reſtored to their former State and condition; which is a thing that is wont to be very eaſily brought about. And to the effecting hereof He ought not to ſpare either for Coſt, Pains, Counſel, or Induſtry.</p>
               <p n="20">20. A Careful Adminiſtration of Juſtice, together with Peace, and Plenty of all things, will contribute much to the bringing of theſe things about; as alſo the Maintaining, and keeping up of Religion, Learning, and Vertue. For ſeeing that thoſe that are of Religious Orders, and other Learned men, and Perſons of Worth, are the men that are as it were the Heads among the reſt of the People; whoſoever hath Theſe of his ſide, he may eaſily draw all the reſt over to him alſo.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:118554:98"/>
               <p>For, thoſe of Religious Orders bear rule over the Conſciences of the People; as the Learned do over their Wits; and thoſe of Eminency and Worth, over their Purſes, and Military ſtrength: Thoſe former are looked upon for their Piety, and Religion; the Other for their Learning and VViſedome: Thoſe through Reverence; Theſe through the Eſteem the World hath of their Parts.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that what ſoever Thoſe men either do, or ſay, it paſſes for Oracular, and is thought worthy to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and followed by All men.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The fame alſo of a Princes being addicted to Mercy, and Clemency, and conſtantly perſevering in the ſame, will ſtand him in very good ſtead; if ſo be that it may be but made known to all men, that this Gentleneſſe, and Connivence in him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds meerly from his own good Nature and Inclination; but that when he puniſheth any, it is out of Neceſſity, and his Zeal towards Juſtice, and the love of the publick Peace. Thus <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> in the beginning of his Empire, by his cunning diſſembling his Natural Inclinations, and his appearing to be a Merciful Prince, wonderfully wonne the hearts and affections of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome to him: which part He acted ſo cunningly, and to the life, as that, when a certain Sentence of Judgment, that had been pronounced by the Judges againſt an offender, was brought to Him to ſet his hand to it. He ſighing ſaid, <hi>O quam vellem li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teras non didiciſſe!</hi> I could wiſh, I had never known a letter.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The Raies of ſome extraordinary, eminent Vertue, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth in a Prince, would alſo be of very great advantage to Him: for by this meanes he would not only oblige his own Subjects to him, but even his Enemies would be won over to love, and favour him; examples whereof we have in <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Scipio;</hi> both of which gave teſtimony to the World of their Singular Continency, and Moderation in all things; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Camillus,</hi> and <hi>Fabricius;</hi> who both gave evidence of the Greatneſſe of their Courage, the one againſt the <hi>Faliſci:</hi> and the other againſt King <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> Theſe ſparks of <hi>Gallantry</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo in the Emperour <hi>Conrade,</hi> in his war again <hi>Miſico;</hi> and likewiſe in <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who beſides his diligent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Religion, and his endeavours to promote Learning, got himſelf a great deal of Reputation alſo by his Beneficence, and Liberality towards all ſorts of men, both the higheſt, loweſt,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118554:99"/>and of middle ranke, and indeed generally to all. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is not a more Lovely, ſtrong, and commendable Tye, whereby to bind the Affections of the People to a man, then Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and Bountifulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But above all things, it would be a buſineſſe of very great Efficacy, if that ſuch Covenants and Agreements as have been made betwixt the King and them were but kept; which yet the Spaniards have neglected to do, though to their Coſt, and the loſſe of their own lives. For, nothing doth more offend, and alienate the hearts both of Natural, as well as conquered ſubjects, then when they ſee that thoſe Capitulations, as they call them, and Articles, upon which they have ſubmitted themſelvs to any Prince, are altered, and changed by him. And we ſee, that this being not obſerved by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and Unjuſt man, and one that looked after nothing but his own Gain; was the cauſe that the Netherlands began to raiſe ſuch Tumults there, and at length openly to rebel againſt the King. Whereas on the contrary, <hi>Alexander Farneſe,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> for his fidelity in keeping his promiſes and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which is certainly an Infallible Argument of a Conſtant Mind, and of an Excellent Judgement, got himſelf an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great repute of Gallantry and worth among the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers. And queſtionleſſe He was a moſt Compleat, and throughly-accompliſhed Souldier; and ſerved as General un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a moſt Juſt King, alwaies commanding an Army under Him, for the ſervice of the Church, and of God; ſometimes following the example of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and ſometimes that of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. Neither would it be a buſineſſe of ſmall moment, to bring in the Spaniſh Tongue into theſe Countries, and to cauſe it to be ſpoken there; according to the Practiſe of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who when they had conquered any Country, cauſed the Nation conquerd to learn the Latine Tongue. Thus did the <hi>Arabians</hi> alſo, after the example of the <hi>Romans,</hi> introduce their Language into a great part of <hi>Africk,</hi> and of Spain: and <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> ſurnamed the Conquerour, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, about five hundred years ſince, to do the ſame in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But now, for the introducing of a Language into any conquered Country, it is neceſſary, in the firſt place that the Lawes of that Country be written in the ſaid Language, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118554:99"/>that the Lawyers Plead in that Language in all Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature; and likewiſe that all Commiſſions, Proclamations, and Petitions, be publiſhed, or written in no other Language but that. This was alſo done heretofore by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who having made himſelf Maſter of the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which He afterwards beſtowed upon the Church, He would have it called by the Name of <hi>Romania;</hi> that ſo by degrees He might bring into diſuſe the Language, and Cuſtomes of the Greeks, to whom that People had been formerly ſubject; and might withal implant in them the love both of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour. And even the Great Turk alſo does not ſuffer any of the Inhabitants of <hi>Natolia</hi> to uſe any other Language but the Turkiſh, ſave onely in their <hi>Church Services.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Education</hi> alſo ſeemes to have a great ſtroke herein, as being indeed, as it were, a ſecond Nature; by the meanes whereof, ſtrangers are in a manner Naturalized. The King of Spain therefore ſhould do well to take the Sons of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Principal men, as alſo ſuch Poor mens ſons, ar are found to be endued with any extraordinary Natural Parts; and to take order that they may be carefully brought up in ſome of the afore mentioned <hi>Seminaries</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> either of Armes, or of Arts. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, finding the benefit of this courſe, commanded that ſo many Thouſands of the <hi>Pe ſian</hi> Youth ſhould be picked out, and be Trained up in Learning the uſe of Armes, &amp; in the Habit, and Manners of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> conceiving that He ſhould by this meanes receive as much benefit by them, when they were once grown up to be men, as by his own Natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Macedonia</hi> themſelves. After the ſame manner doth the Turk bring up his <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are onely the Children of ſuch of his Subjects as he hath conquered by war, or elſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Forreigners, ſuch as he can catch abroad at Sea; which afterwards prove the moſt faithful Souldiers to him that ever he had. And indeed theſe are the men, to whom the Guard and Protection of the Emperours perſon is committed; and theſe men doth the Great Turk make uſe of only, in all Affaires of the greateſt conſequence, where there is moſt need either of ſtrength, or Fidelity. By meanes of the Turks thus bringing up of the ſons of his ſubjects, He makes two great Advantages to himſelf; For, firſt he deprives his unfaithful ſubjects of their ſtrength; and then, ſecondly, by that ſtrength of theirs, of which he hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, he confirmeth his own.</p>
               <p n="26">
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:118554:100"/>26. I would adviſe Our King, not to deſpiſe, or make light of any the leaſt Commotions, or Diſtempers among his Nobles, or Subjects: for, all Miſchiefs have but ſmall Beginnings; which yet, if they be neglected, and not looked unto in time, will very probably bring Ruine with them in the end: as we ſee, the leaſt Clouds in appearance at firſt, do in the end produce moſt Horrid Tempeſts and ſtorms.</p>
               <p n="27">27. I would not have the King to aſſent to the Propoſal of any thing, that may introduce with it any Change, or Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the State: for, His very giving way to have the ſame deliberated upon, addes both Authority, and eſteem to the ſame. All the Troubles that have befallen, both in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> took their Riſe from Two little Books; of which the one was read to <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, King of <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Caspar Coligni;</hi> and the other was preſented to the Ducheſſe of <hi>Parma</hi> by the <hi>L. de Brederode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Let the King take heed, how he ever exerciſes his Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power among thoſe people, where His Ordinary Power will ſerve the turn well enough: for, That way of proceeding is proper to Tyrants only; but this Later, to Good Princes. And indeed, all Abſolute, and Extream Power may rather be ſaid to be <hi>Tempeſt as,</hi> then <hi>Poteſt as,</hi> a <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> rather then <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. Let there be all care taken, about the chuſing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State in thoſe Countries, that only ſuch be made choyce of, as are but juſt ſufficient to diſcharge the Truſt committed to them; and that they be neither too much above it, nor beneath it: which we find to have been carefully obſerved by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Tiberius.</hi> For, thoſe whoſe Abilities are above the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are put upon, will be apt to neglect the ſame, as deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, and thinking it below them: and then, the other are not able to diſcharge it, if they would.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let Him never ſo much truſt to any Peace, as to make him quite lay aſide his Armes: for, ſuch an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>narmed Peace</hi> would prove but a weak one. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, enjoying now a Settled Peace every where round about Him, disbanded all the Souldiers that lay in Garriſons upon the Borders of his Empire: by which means He ſet open a Gate for the Barbarous Nations, to break in upon His Territories. And in like manner <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt, truſting too much to the Truce agreed upon betwixt Him and the <hi>Turk,</hi> and thereupon laying down
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118554:100"/>his Armes, was the cauſe of the Ruine of very many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>And thus have we diſcourſed of theſe Particulars, as copiouſly as we thought was fit to be committed to Paper: but, as for the reſt of thoſe more. <hi>Secret Particulars,</hi> and which are more worthy of Obſervation, I ſhall reſerve them till ſome other time, when it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſtie to admit me to his Preſence, and ſhall give me Audience concerning the ſame. However, in the mean time, thoſe things which we have here propoſed, are not to be omitted: for, unleſſe by theſe Means here ſet down, the Peoples good Affection towards their King be ſtirred up, and cheriſhed, His Dominion in thoſe parts will prove to be but like a Plant without any Root. For, as every the leaſt Storm will be apt to overturn a Tree that hath no firm Root in the ground; in like manner will every the leaſt Occaſion offered alienate the hearts of the Subjects from their Prince, where they are but ill affected to Him before; and will take them off from their Allegiance to their Natural Prince; and being thenceforth hurried about by Fortune, they will one while adhere to One, and by and by again to Another. And hence ariſe all the Mutations that we ſee, in Kingdoms, and States: a moſt evident Example whereof we have in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>

The reſt of the Kings in <hi>Africk</hi> have but very ſmall Dominions; except only the King of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> who is commonly called <hi>Preſter John,</hi> and hath above fifty ſmaller Kingdomes under him.

                  <hi>Abyſſines</hi> is a Chriſtian, although He doth not profeſſe the Pure, Catholick Religion. It is neceſſary therefore, that Forces ſhould be brought over thence into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing that the paſſage to and fro is very eaſie. For, our King is poſſeſſed of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Oran</hi> there already, where He is in continual Wars with the <hi>Moors:</hi> who might eaſily all of them be conquered, if he ſhould but make One Invaſion only upon them with an Army of <hi>Germans.</hi> Neither indeed need the King fear any Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to His <hi>Spaniſh Monarchy</hi> from thoſe Parts. For, thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are much fitter to ſerve, then to Command, and bear Rule: neither have They ever been able to conquer any of the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, but rather themſelves have been alwaies conquered by Them: excepting only <hi>Carthage,</hi> which was a Colony of <hi>Tyre;</hi> who yet were at length utterly ruined by the <hi>Romans.</hi> And the <hi>Arabians</hi> alſo paſſed over out of <hi>Africk</hi> into <hi>Spain;</hi> where they kept their footing for the ſpace of Eight Hundred yeares; yet were at length quite driven out again. Neither indeed were they truly <hi>Africans:</hi> but only the Novelty of their Armes, together with that of their <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion encouraged them ſo far, as to fall upon ſo bold an attempt. But the <hi>Africans</hi> at this day are a very Weak, unwarlike People: and, for as much as they are Naturally Envious, Crafty, and of a ſervile Nature, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by making uſe of one of the little Kings there, might in a little time break in upon them, and make his way to the moſt Inmoſt Countries of all <hi>Africk;</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> of old did, by the help of <hi>Maſiniſſa.</hi> And therefore <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> did wiſely, when he made uſe of the King of <hi>Fez</hi> his ſons, for the getting, and poſſeſſing himſelf of that Kingdom; although he was not ſo very wiſe, in venturing his own Perſon in that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And indeed, becauſe that the ſons of thoſe Kings are wont to kill one another, they are ſo much the more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, if a man do but make any one of them over to him. But ſeeing theſe People are ſo much divided among themſelves, there is no need of fearing them at all.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> ought therefore to get further footing in <hi>Africk;</hi> ſeeing that he hath opportunity enough of doing ſo, by reaſon of the many ſtrong Holds that He is Maſter of, all along the Weſtern, and Southern Coaſt of <hi>Africk.</hi> And He ſhould do well, to make over to him the above named <hi>Preſter John;</hi> whom he ſhould cunningly ſet againſt the reſt, and get him to make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118554:101"/>War upon them. And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may very eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract friendſhip with this <hi>Preſter John</hi> by means of the Jeſuites, whom he may ſend thither; And He ſhould alſo, by his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ſent to him for that purpoſe, put him in mind of the Duty, and Obedience that he owes to the Pope; (which was formerly done in the time of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. and <hi>Clemens</hi> VII. by means of the <hi>Portuguez;</hi>) and ſo ſhould make a League with him. There ſhould therefore be ſent thither ſuch as are both true Catholicks, and Learned men, to inſtruct them in the Arts, and in the True Religion, both which they are as yet Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of: For, they would be eaſily converted; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe they ſay it hath been heretofore fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them, by a certain Propheteſſe, whoſe name was <hi>Sinoda,</hi> that They were predeſtinated to joyn with the <hi>Latines,</hi> and to root out the Turk, and to ſet at Liberty the Holy Sepulchre of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that the King of Spain is Maſter of all the <hi>African</hi> ſhores, He muſt make it his care, that none may have any Fleets to paſſe by the ſaid Coaſts: but that it may be free and ſafe for the aforeſaid <hi>Preſter John,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> to ſayl into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> when ever he pleaſes, by the Gulf of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and there to fall upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to do them what miſchief he can. And to this purpoſe He is to be furniſhed with all Neceſſary Means, (as namely, Engines of War, and other ſuch Proviſions) whereby he may be the better enabled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the <hi>Turk.</hi> For, if <hi>Mahumetaniſme</hi> ſhould but once be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into that Kingdom of his, it would prove extreamly prejudicial to the whole Chriſtian World, and eſpecially to <hi>Spain.</hi> He may alſo come in by <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo fall upon the <hi>Turk.</hi> And if there were but a gallant Fleet lying about <hi>Naples,</hi> that might go out at pleaſure, and ſcour the Seas all along the Northern Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> it might eaſily be brought under the King of Spain's power: and thoſe Slaves alſo that are at <hi>Algier,</hi> and in <hi>Cyrene,</hi> might be dealt with, to riſe up all at once, and rebel, in favour of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> And ſuch a Fleet, as I but now ſpake of, might be maintained meerly by the Prizes that they ſhould take: and ſo by that means would both <hi>Italy</hi> be ſecured; and all ſuch other places alſo, that are now obſtacles to the <hi>Spaniſh Monarchy,</hi> might be taken in.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King of <hi>Spain</hi> muſt endeavour by all Means poſſible to hinder the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Taprobana,</hi> from putting out any Fleets of Ships to Sea; and alſo the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians;</hi> for theſe people would queſtionleſſe be a great hinderance to his Affaires in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and would annoy His Fleet in its paſſage that way: and might alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably infect the New-converted Chriſtians there with <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſme.</hi> He ought therefore to build ſtrong Caſtles all along the Coaſts of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and ſo likewiſe upon the Coaſts of the <hi>Arabian Gulf,</hi> and alſo in all the Southern Iſlands that lye upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> and He ſhould enter into a League with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> And yet perhaps He need not ſo much care to have the <hi>Turk</hi> quite extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated; for, whoſoever of thoſe two, ſhould over come the other, whether the <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Perſian,</hi> he would thereby become ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, as that he would be able to conquer the whole Chriſtian World, and ſo conſequently to ſpoyl all the hopes of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy: and it might prove as Prejudicial to Chriſtendom, to have the <hi>Turk</hi> ruined by any other, but ſome Chriſtian Prince; as it would be for the advantage of Chriſtendome, that he ſhould be conquered by the Chriſtians themſelves alone.</p>
               <p>But yet, ſeeing that the <hi>Turk</hi> does us continually very much harm, breaking in upon us by <hi>Hungary, Solavonia,</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> it would be good Policy to ſet the <hi>Perſian</hi> upon him; and to take a courſe that He may have <hi>Guns,</hi> and ſuch like Artillery ſent unto him, to make uſe of in his Warres againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> For, it was meerly the want of theſe, that was the cauſe that He loſt almoſt all <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that the <hi>Turk</hi> is now ſo Potent in the Eaſt, and that he ſo little fears the <hi>Perſian,</hi> as he does: for by this means, whiles he is making War upon the Chriſtians in the Weſt, He is ſecure from all danger from <hi>Aſia;</hi> and ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118554:102"/>gets ground upon us daily more and more. It would be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient therefore to make a League with the <hi>Perſian;</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in reſpect of the Kings Negotiations in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> becauſe that His Fleet muſt paſſe by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Coaſt. And I am of opinion alſo, that the ſame ought to be done with the Kings of <hi>Calecut, Narſinga,</hi> and <hi>Caramania:</hi> but theſe are not to be furniſhed with Guns. They may indeed be inſtructed in the Art of Printing, and other Arts, that are in uſe among the Chriſtians: to the end they may thereby have the Chriſtians in admiration, and high eſteem; and that by the introducing of Ingenious Arts and Sciences amongſt them, they may be made our Own. And yet Arts are wont to become a Prey to Armes at laſt; unleſſe they be both equally in practiſe together. And hence it is that <hi>Pallas,</hi> in the Fable, is ſaid to have overcome both <hi>Calliope,</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> becauſe She was experienced as well in the uſe of <hi>Mars</hi> his Armes, as <hi>Calliope's</hi> Arts.</p>
               <p>The like courſe is to be taken with thoſe of <hi>Taprobana, China,</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> by communicating our <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> to them; as <hi>Printing, Painting,</hi> and the like; which will be very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by them; and by the means of which, they may by degrees be won over, and may be brought to embrace the Chriſtian Faith. But thoſe that deal with them, muſt be ſure, that above all things they abſtain from Covetouſneſſe, and exerciſing of Cruelty upon any of theſe people; leſt otherwiſe they ſhould be provoked, and ſhould joyn all together againſt us, and ſhould thereby prove a great hinderance to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Deſigns.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not need to ſpeak any thing here of the Great Cham of <hi>Cataia,</hi> ſeeing that his Country lies ſo far out of the road that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> takes in his Voyage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> notwithſtanding that the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> have cauſe enough to ſtand in fear of him: and we know very well, that the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> have many times over-run all <hi>Aſia;</hi> and that alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Chriſtians, they reſtored unto Us <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they once ſaw Our Unworthy, Baſe Diſpoſition, in that, notwithſtanding we all profeſſed the ſame Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we were yet continually at War one with another; they forſook Chriſtianity again, and preſently embraced <hi>Mahumeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> which at that time flouriſhed infinitely, and was in high eſteem throughout the Whole Eaſt. And by this means was it,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:118554:103"/>that they came to give over making war any longer upon the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> whom they now ſuffered to live quietly, without being at all annoyed by Them, who yet had in former times often overthrown, and beaten them: But, on the other ſide, they were more and more alienated from the Chriſtian Faith, and from the Chriſtians, whom they ſaw to be ſo Baſe, and Unworthy, as to be continually at diſcord and variance amongſt themſelves. And yet I believe, that the Glorious <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Monarchy,</hi> which encompaſſeth the whole Earth, will ſhortly reduce them, and bring them to embrace again the Chriſtian Religion: eſpecially if there ſhould any Wars break out in the Eaſtern Parts; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe that <hi>Macon</hi> is now divided into many ſeveral Sects. Beſides, the People of <hi>Galecut,</hi> and of <hi>Goa,</hi> are Chriſtians already, though but <hi>Neſtorians:</hi> yet they might eaſily be brought to embrace the True, Primitive Chriſtian Religion, if it were but propoſed to them to conſider, that God hath alwaies preſerved the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and firmly ſettled it in its own Proper Seat, and Power: whereas on the Contrary, all the Hereſies of others have been ſucceſſeleſſe, and could never get any Dominion, or Authority throughout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome: as appears by <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Macedonius; Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris,</hi> and all other Authors of Hereſies.</p>
               <p>Now I do not know any thing that would cauſe thoſe moſt Remote Kingdoms to admire us more, and that would ſooner draw the Inhabitants of the ſame from their Superſtitions, and would beſides weaken them too, and make them unapter for War, then if the Knowledge of the <hi>Liberal Arts,</hi> the <hi>Languages, Philoſophy,</hi> and the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> were carried thither from hence, by ſome of our Weſtern Profeſſors of the ſame; becauſe that

                     <l>Take off, and Chill our hearts.</l>
                  </q> Let the King therefore take care, that Forraigners may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed only in Idle, Umbratil Sciences, and Light, toyiſh matters, and Paſtimes: but in the mean time let Him keep His own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects to the exerciſe of their Armes alſo, together with thoſe forenamed Sciences: by which Means He may ſtill be victorious.</p>

               <p>But laſtly, (that we may return to our former diſcourſe, touching the <hi>Perſians</hi> aiding us againſt the Turks,) The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> having alwayes relyed wholly upon the Number, and Goodneſſe of their Horſe, have notwithſtanding in the mean time, while they have been Victorious in the Open Field, yet loſt their Cities at home. And therefore I ſay, they are to be adviſed to fortifie their Cities with Caſtles, and ſtrong Holds every where. For the Turk, although he have been many times beaten by them, hath yet by litle and litle ſo entrenched himſelf about, as it were, with Garriſons, and Fortifications, made in all convenient places, that he hath by this means made himſelf Maſter of a very great part of the <hi>Perſians</hi> Country, and hath poſſeſſed himſelf at laſt alſo of the great City <hi>Tauris,</hi> or <hi>Ecbatan.</hi> They muſt be taught therefore to make uſe of the ſame Arts in defending themſelves, by which they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been beaten.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y what means the <hi>Turk</hi> endeavours to make himſelf Lord of the whole World, hath been, as I conceive, ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before in this Treatiſe: and He will alſo at this time already be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Lord;</hi> as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is called, <hi>The Catholick King:</hi> ſo that theſe two Princes ſeem now to ſtrive, which of them ſhall attain to the Univerſal Monarchy of the whole World. And therefore I think it not amiſſe to examine here, in what Particulars the one of them is either Inferiour, or ſuperiour to the other.</p>
               <p>The Great <hi>Turk</hi> is the moſt Abſolute Lord of, and Heir to all the Goods that his ſubjects have, throughout his whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: and not of their <hi>Goods</hi> only, but alſo of their <hi>Perſons.</hi> And in this, He is worſe then ever any Tyrant was; in that He arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates all to Himſelf: and, becauſe that although He calls all his People, His <hi>Sons;</hi> Yet He doth not, like a Father, ſuffer them
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118554:104"/>to inherit any thing; but only beſtowes yearly upon every one of them as much as He thinks fit, appointing them withal the Employments that they ſhall ſerve him in. He hath alſo a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is framed according to his own Will only, without taking the adviſe with him of any <hi>Arch-Prieſt.</hi> He hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a moſt Able Souldiery; becauſe that He takes all the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt boyes, and youths through all his Dominions, and breeds them up in <hi>Seminaries,</hi> erected for that purpoſe: and theſe He employes both in his wars abroad, and in peace at home; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome of them Souldiers, and others, Judges, and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo.</p>
               <p>Neither hath He any Barons to ſtand in fear of; neither hath He any Brothers to ſhare with Him in the Empire: For, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, comming to the Empire after his Fathers death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently makes away with all his Younger Brothers. Neither can He want any Men: ſeeing that He permits every one of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take as many Wives to him as He is able to keep: ſo that neither Inheritance, nor Virginity are any hinderance to the Procreation of Children in his Territories. His cuſtome is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in making his Wars, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>eighbouring enemies; neither leaving any enemy behind him, nor ever going farther from home one way then another, as hath been ſaid before. And he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an Admirable Art in his making his Ceſſations from Arms, and Truces with his Enemies; being ſure alwayes to make them for his own Advantage.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Turk</hi> is deſcended from <hi>Iaphet,</hi> by <hi>Magog;</hi> and he hath the Lawes of <hi>Sem,</hi> derived to Him by <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> whence hath ſprung <hi>Mahumetaniſme.</hi> And of Him, God himſelf fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told <hi>Agar,</hi> that <hi>His hand ſhould be againſt every man; and every mans hand againſt him:</hi> and, that <hi>He ſhould dwell in the preſence of all his brethren.</hi> And therefore we ſee, that He hath pitched his Tents at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the uttermoſt Angle of <hi>Europe,</hi> over againſt Us, who are his Brethren, deſcending from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was both the Legitimate, and Natural Brother of <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> For, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are deſcended from <hi>Tubal,</hi> ſo the Turks are deſcended from <hi>Magog;</hi> who were both the Sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly the Turk doth put forth his hand every way, not only againſt all Chriſtians, but alſo againſt <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> now
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118554:104"/>here, now there; one while on the right hand, and then on the left; and ſtill goes away the Conquerour. He makes uſe alſo of another point of ſubtlety, which is, that ſo ſoon as ever He finds that we are at union amongſt our ſelves, He then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently flies to making a Truce with Us: which notwithſtanding he preſently breakes off again, ſo ſoon as ever he ſees us at diſſention among our ſelves. And whenſoever he is returned Victorious from one Country, He preſently falls to the making of ſome other Expedition, either againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> &amp;c. as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And yet though all theſe things be thus, yet doth the King of <hi>Spain</hi> lay claime alſo to the Dominion of that Empire, or at leaſt of part of it, and that by reaſon of his Fraternity, both Natural from <hi>Japhet,</hi> and alſo Legal proceeding from <hi>Abraham;</hi> but yet in reſpect of this Later, he hath the Pre heminence above the Turk. For, he is deſcended from <hi>Iſaac;</hi> from whom <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is alſo God, is deſcended, the Cheif Law-giver of All; and He hath alſo thereby a general Promiſe made him, of the Univerſal Empire of the World.</p>
               <p>And becauſe He was Bleſſed alſo in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the laſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Saints, which is to ſucceed after the end of the Four Monarchies, and of which <hi>Daniel</hi> Propheſied, belongs unto him. But <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> from whom <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Turks Law-giver, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, had no other promiſe made unto him, but that he ſhould be an Abſolute Lord, and a great and famous Warriour. Beſides, both theſe Princes are a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; for after that the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy ſhall be at an end, there ſhall no other ſucceed it.</p>
               <p>But according to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> the <hi>German,</hi> which is now the ſame that the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> (as hath been ſaid before) is the <hi>Right Head,</hi> but the Turk is the <hi>Left Head</hi> of the <hi>Imperial Eagle;</hi> after that <hi>Mahomet</hi> fell off from the Emperour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> during whoſe Reign the <hi>Eagle</hi> was divided: to whom notwithſtanding there was no other promiſe made, but that He ſhould Devour the Middle Head, namely, the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan;</hi> whereas the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard hath this Promiſe made him, that he ſhould devour the Left Head, that is to ſay, the Turk: as we have hinted former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And although that the Spaniard hath above him one that is a Clergy Man, and that is alſo Armed with the Temporal Sword; yet doth this make for his advantage, both in reſpect
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:118554:105"/>of <hi>Fate,</hi> and of His State, as hath been written before; for as much as the Spaniard, according to the example of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hath under him the United Monarchy of the Saints; and the Pope is alſo a moſt ſure defence and Safe-guard to Him; by whoſe Aſſiſtance, he is able to deal well enough with his enemies, both with ſpiritual, and Temporall weapons: and yet ſo, as that He may eaſily withal avoid the ſuſpicion either of Covetouſneſſe or Profaneneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the Abſoluteneſſe of Dominion, the Great Turk is herein much above the King of Spain. But yet I have formerly ſhewed, that this very thing, of his not caring to have any Barons, or Nobles under him, renders Him, and His Condition and State ſo weak, that if he ſhould receive but one ſound Blow onely in an open field Battel, it would ſo cruſh Him, as that he would never be able to hold up his Head again. Which cannot happen to the King of Spain; becauſe that His Nobles, and Biſhops, and alſo the Pope himſelf would ſpeedily in ſuch a caſe ſend in Relief to Him. The Great Turk keeps under all the Great ones among his Subjects, leaſt they ſhould attempt any Innovation in the State, or act any thing to the Prejudice of His Monarchy; as the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> did heretofore. But then in the mean time He doth ſo weaken them, that they are not able to yeild him any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or Aide at all, in caſe he ſhould come to have need of it.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> and the Manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War, the Turk far excells the Spaniard, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed: yet notwithſtanding, if the King of Spain would but uſe all convenient diligence, and withal carefully obſerve thoſe Rules, which I have here laid down before him; He might, even in this Particular, ſurpaſſe the Turk; and the rather, if ſo be He would but go himſelf in Perſon to the Wars.</p>
               <p>And as for the number of Men, and of Souldiers, the Turk goes beyond the Spaniard; and indeed in all his greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, He hath ever done his buſineſſe rather by his Numbers, then by valour. And yet his Subjects are divided amongſt themſelves in Religion; and then beſides, all the Lands of every Country are given in Fee only to the Principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his <hi>Militia:</hi> whereas the King of Spain hath fewer
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:118554:105"/>Subjects indeed in number; but yet they are more at unity among themſelves. But I have already ſhewn how the Number of the King of Spains Subjects may be encreaſed, by their Marriages with Forraign Nations; and alſo how, by meanes of erecting Seminaries for the inſtructing of Youth both in learning, and the uſe of Armes, the Valour of his Souldiers may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; the Neglect of making uſe of Which Meanes, hath been the cauſe, that the <hi>Turk</hi> hath overſtript us in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>As concerning the buſineſſe of Mony, I conceive there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no odds on either ſide. But if the King of Spain would but proceed in that Abſolute way of Power over his Subjects, that the Turk does over his; He might eaſily ſurpaſſe him in Riches. The King, I confeſſe, wants Mony; but I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed him, by what waies He might gather together Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enough to maintain a war againſt the Turk. Now the Turk uſeth infinite Celerity and ſpeed, in putting what ever deſigns He hath in execution, ſparing no coſt or charges for the providing of all things neceſſary for the ſame: ſo that with the preſent Mony that he hath in his Treaſury He preſently raiſeth Men, and provides them Armes, and gets all things immediately in a readineſſe, in order to the expedition He is upon; and when he hath laid out all the Mony that he had in his Treaſurie, he then preſently falls to filling it up again, by laying freſh Impoſitions and Taxes upon his Subjects.</p>
               <p>It is a neceſſity, that is in a manner Peculiar to the Turk, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War upon his Neighbours round about, and as it were in a Circle: for, they are all his enemies. But now, the condition of the Spaniard is otherwiſe. For, betwixt His Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and his Duchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> there lye the Pope and the <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi> who are united unto him by the Tie both of Religion, and Friendſhip. He lies ſomething remote indeed from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Indies:</hi> which notwithſtanding render him worthy the more admiration; becauſe that, by reaſon of his Fleets, he lies as it were neer unto them: and by meanes of the ſame he may poſſibly in time make himſelf Maſter of thoſe other Parts alſo which he hath not yet poſſeſſed himſelf of; as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. The King hath alſo this advantage, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe Countries lye at ſo great a diſtance from one another; yet, by the Tie of Religion, they are all joyned to Spain.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:118554:106"/>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas in <hi>Turky</hi> the Eldeſt ſons of the Emperours are wont alwaies to make away with their Younger brothers, this piece of Cruelty of theirs does but ſet a Note of Infamy upon them: and it may eaſily ſo fall out, that ſome One of theſe Younger Brothers may get away out of his Elder Brothers pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and may be able afterwards to make War upon his Brother. And we ſee that this had been like to have come to paſſe in <hi>Gemes,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Bajazet;</hi> who, having gotten out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, might have been able to have done his Brother very much Miſchief, and, by the Aſſiſtance of the Chriſtians, might have made his way into <hi>Greece,</hi> had he not, by the Arts his Brother <hi>Bajazet</hi> uſed, and by the treachery alſo of the Chriſtians, been taken off by Poyſon. And <hi>Selim,</hi> although He did not deſire to make Himſelf Emperour, yet He made himſelf very ſtrong; at firſt, only to preſerve himſelf from being put to death; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, taking the Opportunity when it was offered him, He turned both his Father, and Brother out of the Empire, and commanded them to be both put to death: at which Juncture of Time, that Empire might very eaſily have been utterly ſubverted, and ruined. And truly I conceive, that the Total deſtruction of that Empire cannot be brought about any other way, then by this one thing; namely, their moſt bloody Cruelty that they Practiſe upon their neareſt, and deareſt Friends and Kindred. For, ſeeing that the great <hi>Turk</hi> takes as many Wives to himſelf as he pleaſes, and ſo gets an Infinite number of Sons by them; all which are moſt certainly aſſured, that, when ever their Eldeſt Brother comes to be Emperour, They ſhall be all of them mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: it is very probable, that ſome time or other there may Civil Wars ariſe in that Empire, by which it may either be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroyed, or at leaſt may be divided into many parts: which would give the <hi>Turks</hi> enemies an Opportunity of falling upon him, and ſo of ruining him. Neither need any one won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this hath not as yet happened to this very day; ſeeing that this Empire is not of any ſo very long ſtanding. For, <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman,</hi> who was the Founder of it, died but in the Year of our Lord 1328. in the time of Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> XI. And yet we know, that there have already been bloody Wars amongſt them; which ſeems to confirm this our Prognoſtication; and makes me the willinger to give credit to <hi>Torquatus</hi> the Aſtrologer, who foretold that it would come to paſſe, that in the time of the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:118554:106"/>Emperour of <hi>Turky,</hi> that Empire ſhould fall to the ground: namely, when the <hi>Moon,</hi> which is the Enſign of that Empire, ſhall begin to decreaſe; that is to ſay, when It ſhall be divided into Two <hi>Hornes,</hi> by two of the Great <hi>Turks</hi> Sons riſing up one againſt the other, and cauſing the Empire to be divided into Two parts: One of which Brothers, turning to Chriſtianity, ſhall come over to the Chriſtians. Now theſe Two <hi>Hornes</hi> ſignifie Two Kingdomes: for Kingdomes are oftentimes denoted by the <hi>Enſigns,</hi> or Armes of the ſame: as we ſee in the <hi>Revelation of St. John,</hi> where the Kingdomes themſelves are from their <hi>Inſignia,</hi> called ſometimes Dragons, ſometimes Eagles, and ſometimes alſo Lions; and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> calleth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> by the name of a <hi>Dove;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had the Figure of a <hi>Dove</hi> for their <hi>Enſign,</hi> or <hi>Deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this Particular the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is much more happy then the Turk; becauſe that His Sons do not fall out, or hate each other for any ſuch Cauſe. Yea, we ſee at this day, that thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> partly by reaſon of this very thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Brothers, and Kindred, and partly alſo through fear of the other Chriſtian Princes, and of the Hereticks, are at ſo much the greater Concord, and Agreement among themſelves. And you ſhall ſcarſe find more Brothers, or Kindred, in any one Princes Family, then in that of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and yet have not theſe ever broken the Bond of Conſanguinity one with another; nor have ever raiſed any Commotions in their Republick, through Ambitious Ends and Reſpects: but have, on the contrary, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved each to other their Juſt Rights Untoucht, and have lived together in ſo Unſhaken a Concord and Union, as that they ſeem to be ſo many Bodies, animated all with One Soul, and guided all by One Will.</p>
               <p>We may adde hereto, that the Younger Brothers of this Houſe have hopes either of being made Cardinals; or elſe of being Elected Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> or of ſome of the other Forreign Elective Kingdoms: ſo that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by reaſon of the Multitude of Sons, growes the Greater; whereas the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Houſe does, for the ſame reaſon, decreaſe every day more and more: not to ſay any thing, how much the <hi>Turk's</hi> Subjects are offended with this Tyranny of his.</p>
               <p>Experience alſo teſtifies, that the Daughters of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have, by their Marriages with other Princes, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118554:107"/>thereby fallen to them, very much advanced the Greatneſſe of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, and have enlarged their Dominions in a wonderful manner: and beſides, they have alſo cauſed the hearts of their Husbands, and of their Subjects, to encline to Our King: and of this we have a clear Example this day in the Wife of the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and likewiſe in the Duke of <hi>Savoy's,</hi> and the King of <hi>Poland's</hi> Wife. And the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family are alſo all of High Spirits, and are beſides adorned with the Endowments of Vertue, and Gravity. Whereas, on the contrary, the Great <hi>Turk</hi> beſtowing his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines only upon his own Slaves, and <hi>Baſſaes,</hi> (as they call them) gets himſelf no advantage at all from abroad; onely He hereby obligeth theſe men to be true and faithful to Him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Opinion is, that it would be the beſt way for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> never to marry a Wife out of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family; unleſſe He ſhould thereby come to inherit ſome New Country: becauſe that it would be much better, that thoſe Daughters ſhould be married abroad to Forreign Princes; that ſo they may turn the hearts and affections of their Husbands toward the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſeeing that, as hath been formerly ſaid, the <hi>Turk</hi> ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth his hand againſt All Men; whence it comes to paſſe, that All men in like manner ſtretch forth their hands againſt Him; all whom yet he is frequently wont to delude by his Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Armes, and Truces, (for He keeps his faith with none of them:) it would be a buſineſſe worth our ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how this Practiſe of his might be turned againſt Himſelf. Which that it may the eaſilier be effected, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould prevail with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to invade <hi>Arabia</hi> with a Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Army, perſwading them, that this would be the only means of ſecuring their Own Territories; and poſſeſſing them withal with this perſwaſion, that the <hi>Turk</hi> is the Common Enemy, and that therefore he ought to be ſet upon on all ſides to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power; leaſt, after they have once overcome us Chriſtians, They themſelves ſhould fall to be his next Prey: And then, that under a Pretenſe of Zeal for Religion, they ſhould poſſeſſe themſelves of the City of <hi>Mecha,</hi> where is the Sepulchre of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was the Head of their Empire: which Deſigns being but once happily, and Proſperouſly accompliſhed, that then all other things would the more eaſily be brought about.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:118554:107"/>
               <p>Let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo take care, that there may be a League made betwixt the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Preſter John;</hi> and this Later ſhould be perſwaded to ſend out as great an Army as he could, to invade the Common Enemies, the <hi>Turk's</hi> Country; which Army ſhould be carried over by the Red Sea, by meanes of the <hi>Portugals</hi> Fleet; or elſe, He may ſend thoſe Forces of his in by Land: and that not onely to enlarge their Own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Dominion, but alſo for the Advancement of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, namely, by recovering of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Sepulcher of our Saviour Chriſt is, which both We, and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> too have now ſo many Ages been deprived of. Both Nations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to bend their whole Forces that way.</p>
               <p>It would alſo be very Convenient, that the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> (who ſhould be perſwaded to this by ſome <hi>Polonian</hi> Oratours) ſhould at the ſame time fall in upon <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> with an Army. And the King ſhould ſo order the Matter, that at one and the ſame time the Emperour, and the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> ſhould fall upon him in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the <hi>Polander</hi> upon <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and <hi>Myſia:</hi> that the <hi>Turk</hi> being by this means ſo diſtracted, may not know which part to relieve firſt. The <hi>Georgians</hi> alſo ſhould be ſecretly dealt withal, to embrace this General Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchants, and to fall upon <hi>Natolia,</hi> and <hi>Trapezond,</hi> or <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And for the promoting of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it would be very convenient, that every one ſhould keep to himſelf what he hath got; except <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only; which ſhould be reſerved for the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> of which Country the King alſo ſhould ſhortly afterward by little and little get the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by making uſe of the Conveniency of the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>I would alſo adviſe, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian,</hi> together with the Pope, entring into a Mutual League together, ſhould at the ſame time alſo fall upon <hi>Morea, Cyprus,</hi> or <hi>Egypt:</hi> for which purpoſe ſuch a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Fleet, as we have formerly ſpoken off, would be of very excellent uſe and Advantage. And afterwards, they ſhould divide ſuch Countries and Places, as they have taken, and ſhare them among themſelves, making the Pope their Judge, and Arbitrator herein. And this Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and League made betwixt the aforeſaid Princes, I would have to laſt for the ſpace of whole ten years. For by this means the Turk having his hands full at home, would be taken off from making War upon the Chriſtians in the Weſt, as he now does,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:118554:108"/>to the great detriment of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this end, it would be very Expedient, that there were a League made both with the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Preſter John:</hi> for theſe People might very much annoy the Weſtern Countries. And this would alſo make very much for the Advantage of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> too, who ſtand in no ſmall dread of the Turks; whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not able to match them in Power, they are fain to pacifie and keep quiet by fair means, and Preſents.</p>
               <p>There are ſome that are of opinion, that there are two wayes by which an Aſſociation, or League might be made by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt the Turk, if not for his total ruine, yet at leaſt to the bringing about of ſome very good effect. And One of theſe is, that all ſuch Princes, whoſe Territories border upon <hi>Turky,</hi> ſhould at one and the ſame time ſet all upon him, every one of them invading that part of the Turks Dominions that lies next him, not with any certain part only of his Forces, but with the whole ſtrength and Power that he can poſſibly make in the World: for ſo, all of them ſhould enjoy an equal ſhare in the ſpoiles that were taken.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, and that the more Noble, is, if that very many ſeveral Princes would but reſolve, for the glory of God, and the Propagation of the Church, to ſet upon the Turk, either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from one part, or elſe from diverſe parts all at once: as we read to have been done in thoſe former Heroick times, when as many ſeveral Valiant Princes, out of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> ſome of them ſelling their Territories outright, and others of them pawning the ſame, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether an Army of above forty Thouſand Men, and marching with them into the Eaſtern Countries, and there beating the Turks out of <hi>Nice,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> out of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the <hi>Saracens</hi> out of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they afterwards laid waſt the whole Eaſt, and in a ſhort time recovered the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In which Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this eſpecially is to be taken notice of, that neither the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himſelf, nor any other King, was either their General, or ſo much as went along with them in it. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that afterwards indeed the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> as alſo the Emperours, <hi>Conrade,</hi> and <hi>Frederick,</hi> made ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions into thoſe parts, not for the taking in of any New Countries, but only for the keeping of what the others had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gotten; yet for all there was not any thing at all done by them, worth the ſpeaking of.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:118554:108"/>
               <p>But now there ought to be care taken, in this buſineſſe, that all may ſhare alike in what ſhall be gotten: for otherwiſe, the Deſign would be quite ſpoiled, and never come to any thing. For, as in a Clock, if there be any one Exorbitant, or Irregular Wheel, it ſpoiles the whole Harmony, and mutual Agreement that ſhould be in it: ſo likewiſe, in all Aſſociations, if there be any Deficiency in one Part, it proves to be the cauſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the whole Union.</p>
               <p>A clear example whereof we have in the League that was made betwixt the Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> III. and <hi>Pius</hi> V. the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians:</hi> which though it were managed with the greateſt diligence, and eagerneſſe on all ſides that could be, and with Incredible ſucceſſe alſo; yet it came all to nothing at laſt; and that meerly for this one reaſon, namely, becauſe that it did not equally concern the Intereſts of all of them, that That Expedition ſhould be ſo carefully undertaken, and ſo diligently carried on. For, Spain hath no great advantage by any thing that is done againſt the Eaſtern People; which yet is moſt beneficial to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> in like manner as it is of litle or no concernment to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> what ever is done againſt <hi>Africk,</hi> which yet is of very great advantage to Spain.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon, that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who ſtand in fear of the Power the Turk hath in the Eaſt; and the Spaniards who are afraid of their Neighbours of <hi>Algier,</hi> can never unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly go on together againſt the Enemy, with equal courage, and deſires. And by this means the Pope, lying in the mean time in the midſt betwixt them both, and being forced to be at a great charge, yet hath no benefit at all thereby. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Preſent diſcourſe again, whence we have digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>There is yet another way, whereby the Turkiſh Empire might be over thrown; and that is, in caſe that ſome one of His Chief Commanders in war, who was at firſt a Chriſtian (ſuch as were <hi>Cicala, Occhiali,</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) ſhould be prevailed withal, by ſuch large Promiſes as ſhould be made him, as namely, that he ſhould have ſome Chriſtian Province given him for his reward,) to betray the Turkiſh Navy unto us, if at leaſt He have it committed to his charge: or elſe, in caſe he hath been appointed by the Great Turk to manage any Kingdom under him, as His <hi>Viceroy;</hi> he ſhould then have the poſſeſſion
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118554:109"/>of that Kingdom promiſed him; as ſuppoſe, of <hi>Tunis, Algier,</hi> or the like. For there is no doubt to be made, but that ſuch a one had rather be the Sole Abſolute Lord of any Kingdom, whatſoever it be, and ſo to have the Power of tranſmitting it over to his Poſterity; then to be but a kind of Nobler Slave to the Great Turk; having neither Power in his life time to give away any thing to his friends; nor at his death to leave any thing to them, And I am verily perſwaded, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that keeps theſe men from attempting ſuch a Rebellion againſt the Turk, more, then becauſe they diſpaire of ever being able to bring any ſuch their Undertakings to effect; as not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to confide in the Chriſtians, or to rely upon them for Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Yet if they were but ſincerely, and Ingenuouſly dealt withal, I am clearly of opinion, that they might be brought to this.</p>
               <p>It may alſo ſo happen, that ſome ſuch Gallant Vindicator of the Peoples Liberty may ſpring up among the Turks themſelves, as was <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Hebrew, among the Subjects of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſuch a One, in caſe the Great Turk ſhould entruſt him with any great Authority, or Charge, might queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe be able to do him an infinite deal of Miſchief. There might alſo a General Aſſociation be made amongſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; by whom He might be brought to a Pitch'd Battel; (as we ſaid before) and might have one or two ſuch Notable Blowes given him by them, that he ſhould be never able to hold up his head again: becauſe that he hath not any Nobles, that might relieve him in ſuch a caſe. And this might the more eaſily be done, becauſe that he hath within his Dominions an Infinite Number both of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Jewes:</hi> who, if they but once ſaw him overthrown, would all preſently come over to Us. And yet in the procuring of ſuch an Aſſociation as this, there would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired either very much Patience in the Pope, and the King of Spain; or elſe a very great neceſſity, that ſhould force All of them to joyne together.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Princes ſhould all be bound, by mutual Covenants drawn up betwixt them, that every one of them ſhould have a Proportionable Share of what ſoever ſhall be gotten by the ſaid expedition; and alſo that thoſe that have gotten poſſeſſion of their own ſhare, ſhall aſſiſt the reſt alſo in the getting of theirs; after the Example of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and <hi>Dan:</hi> who after they had poſſeſſed themſelves of the Country that lay on this ſide <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:118554:109"/>were then to aſſiſt their brethren in the ſubduing of the further part of it, that lay beyond <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There ought alſo to be a perſuaſion wrought into All, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe Princes, that by the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is prefigured unto us the Great Turk: who, after he hath deſtroyed the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is to ſay, the Kingdom of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or that of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> He will then next over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> except they repent them of their Hereſy, and return again into the Boſome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is our <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> (as I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in my <hi>Chriſtian Monarchy</hi>) and that ſo, together with the <hi>Empire,</hi> the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> alſo will be loſt, and will paſſe over into the New World, (as I have there demonſtrated by Political Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,) except they take the Courſe here ſet down before them. And perhaps alſo it may hereafter ſo come to paſſe. And when the Turk, who is the <hi>Typical Cyrus,</hi> is deſtroyed, then ſhall the Church be renewed again. It is therefore moſt Neceſſary, that all Chriſtendom ſhould joyn their forces together, for the deſtruction of this Ravenous Wolf, who by his Strength, and Cunning, hath taken from us Two Empires, and Two Hundred Kingdomes; mean while that we do nothing but fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> together by the Eares one with another. But if this cannot be brought about, the <hi>Perſians</hi> muſt then be perſuaded to joyn with the <hi>Ethiopians, Muſcovites,</hi> and <hi>Polonians,</hi> as hath been ſaid before. And I do believe alſo, that the Great <hi>Turks Baſſaes,</hi> and other of his Subjects would quickly be got to fall off from him, if ſo be they could but be once fully perſwaded &amp; aſſured, that they ſhould each of them really be made the abſolute Lords of what they now poſſeſſed. All which things ought to have their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in the death of this <hi>Mahomet</hi> III. now Raigning, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that That Number is Fatal. The Great Turks Younger Sons alſo are to be ſeazed upon, and conveigh'd away, leaſt the Eldeſt Brother ſhould Murder them according to their uſual Cuſtome: and this the <hi>Venetians</hi> may do conveniently enough by their Merchants; or elſe the ſame may be committed to the Chriſtian Slaves that are there, to be done by them.</p>
               <p>After that this Empire ſhall be thus weakned, and divided, it would be convenient then to ſend thether ſome Preachers, who ſhould endeavour to convince the Natives of their Error. There ſhould care alſo be taken by all meanes for the bringing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:118554:110"/>of Printing into <hi>Turky;</hi> by meanes whereof that People may be taken off from the exerciſe of Arms, and may apply themſelves to Books; and by being taken up with Diſputations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Points of Divinity, and Philoſophy, both of the <hi>Peripateticks, Stoicks, Platoniſts,</hi> and <hi>Teleſians,</hi> they may be divided amongſt themſelves, and ſo be the more weakned. For, thoſe that give themſelves to the ſtudy of Books onely, uſually become a Prey to ſuch as apply themſelves to the exerciſe of Armes, and the ſtudy of the Arts too: as we ſee in the example of <hi>Athens,</hi> which became a Prey to the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> both which Nations <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> by the force of his Armes afterwards ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, being firſt inſtructed by <hi>Epaminondas</hi> by what meanes this was to be effectd. <hi>Cato</hi> was wont to ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi> would loſe their Empire, ſo ſoon as ever they ſhould begin to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of the Greek Tongue, and Sciences. This the Great Turk, who is wiſer then We are, knew very well; and therefore preferred rather the exerciſe of Armes, and got him great Guns, and Slaves; I mean, thoſe Jewes, that were ſent to him by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Arragon:</hi> for he knew very well, what, and how great Advantage might be made by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>es; and that the Children that they ſhould beget, were to be brought up in the exerciſe of Armes, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Military Affaires.</p>
               <p>But then, on the contrary, He would not receive, nor accept of thoſe <hi>Printing-Preſſes,</hi> and <hi>Letter,</hi> for the Printing of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Tongue, that were ſent Him by the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> becauſe he would not have his Dominions filled with Books, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would much take off the Military Valour of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and beſides, becauſe that <hi>Mahumetaniſme,</hi> by frequent Diſputations about it, might eaſily in a ſhort time have been overthrown.</p>
               <p>It hath alſo been very prejudicial unto Us, that we have had no Law made for the Injoyning of <hi>Silence;</hi> whereby we ſhould have been commanded to conceal ſome things from others: which Law certainly would have been of very good uſe. But now adaies in <hi>Germany</hi> all things are made Publick, and laid open to the whole World: and hence it is, that we ſee every one there publiſheth in Print a New <hi>Bible;</hi> and that the Empire goes to ruine, and that all places are overwhelmed with Luxury, and Riot. And, had not the fear of the King of Spain's Armies kept the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118554:110"/>
                  <hi>Netherlanders</hi> in Awe, they alſo would by this time have been as Effeminate, and Luxurious as the <hi>Germans</hi> are. And the like would have befallen to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo. So that we might have hopes, that unleſſe there were a War maintained amongſt them, to keep them in exerciſe, they would all quickly come to utter ruine; after that they ſhould but once come to be Effeminate, Heart-leſſe, and at diſcord one with another; as we have ſaid formerly: and that ſo much the rather, becauſe that the Hereſie they profeſſe, ſeeing it denyes the <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> is repugnant to all Principles of <hi>Policy.</hi> Now all Hereſies, when they are once gone ſo far as to Atheiſme, are reduced again into the way of Truth by ſome Wiſe Prophet or other; ſuch as were in <hi>Italy, Thomas Aquinas, Dominicus, Scotus,</hi> and others. For, Hereſies alſo have their Periods, as well as States; which fall firſt, from being governed by good Kings, into the hands of Tyrants; from their Tyranny, into an Ariſtocracy, from thence into an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and ſo at length to a Democracy; and in the end they ſhift about again, and in a Circle, as it were, return again to their firſt form, either of a Kingdom, or a Tyranny.</p>

For, ſome of the Ancienteſt among the Philoſophers, of which number was <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> were of Opinion, that That <hi>Other Hemiſphere</hi> lay all covered over with Water; ſome others, as <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> thought that the Earth was not a Perfect <hi>Globe,</hi> about which the Sun was carried in his Diurnal Motion. And ſome others believed, (among whom was <hi>Dante,</hi>)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118554:111"/>that thoſe Countries were Inhabited, and were a certain kind of Earthly Paradiſe. Some there were that doubted hereof; amongſt whom was <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> and again ſome others of them confidently affirmed, that the Earth was an Abſolute and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Orbe,</hi> or <hi>Globe:</hi> and of this number were <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> And therefore it is but for juſt cauſe, that all the World admires the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, as both very Daring, and very Powerful; ſeeing that It hath meaſured, and overcome ſo many Seas, and in a ſhort ſpace of time hath put a girdle about the vaſt Globe of the Whole Earth: which neither <hi>Carthage,</hi> nor <hi>Tyre</hi> were ever heretofore able to do; nor yet the wiſeſt of All Men, King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi> whoſe Fleet, making its Voyage as far as <hi>Goa</hi> only, and <hi>Taprobane,</hi> ſpent alwaies three whole years in the ſame; which yet Our Seamen now adaies perform in three Moneths time. So that, although the Vaſt diſtance of place, that there is betwixt the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, ſeems to render It Weak; yet doth their Admirable Skill in Navigation, for the ſhortening of thoſe Diſtances, together with thoſe other Means of Uniting theſe Parts, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> daily do make uſe of, or, may make uſe of, when they pleaſe, make the ſame moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and more Admirable, then ſome perhaps do imagine.

In a word, They could not chooſe but have all yielded themſelves up freely, and of their own accord, to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who, as they were really perſwaded, were all <hi>Gods;</hi> had not They themſelves, by their own Diſſolute and Corrupt Life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all ſuch Opinion of Divinity far from them, by their Cruelty, and Covetouſneſſe in hunting after the <hi>Indians</hi> Gold, which they themſelves regarded not: inſomuch that the Natives were fain to betake themſelves to the Mountains, and to defend themſelves againſt them as well as they could. And this is the reaſon, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could never make themſelves Maſters of the whole Country of <hi>Peruana,</hi> (which is half as big again as all <hi>Africa</hi>) but were fain to keep about the Sea Coaſts, and thoſe Plain and Open Countries that border upon the ſame; nor could ever get any farther Northward then <hi>Florida, New Spain,</hi> and <hi>New France, Baccalaos,</hi> and the Country about <hi>Mexico,</hi> but were alwaies repulſed by the Natives. Whence it plainly appears, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought at the firſt to have cheriſhed that good Opinion which the <hi>Indians</hi> had all generally conceived of them, by their Innocent, and Vertuous Life: for, by this means, they muſt needs have become Maſters of the whole Country. And beſides, they ſhould have openly profeſſed, and made it known to all, that They were really the Sons of <hi>God,</hi> and not of the <hi>Clouds;</hi> and were ſprung from a much Nobler Seed, and were endowed with an Immortal Soul: and that it was <hi>God,</hi> that had created both the Heavens and the Earth, and that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of, and governeth all things according to his own will and pleaſure: and that by how much the more Noble any Creature is, (ſuch as are <hi>Men,</hi> who are His Sons, being created after His Image,) ſo much the Greater, and more Vigilant Care hath He over Them, then over the reſt. So likewiſe they ſhould have informed them further, how that All Men ſinned in their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Firſt Parent, <hi>Adam;</hi> whom they have ever ſince imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that which is Evil, rather then that which is Good: Yet notwithſtanding, that God, who is the Father of All, loved them ſo dearly, that He found out a Means of calling them back again to His Worſhip, and of tranſlating them at length even into Heaven it ſelf, ſending amongſt them <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and others to inſtruct them. But, that They, growing continually Worſe and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:118554:112"/>Worſe, provoked God, their Father, to wrath; who therefore ſuddenly ſwept them all away, except One only Family, by an Univerſal Deluge. And, that it is the Same God, that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vaſt Sea betwixt them, had divided Their World from Ours, which very thing was aſſerted heretofore by <hi>Plato,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean. And, that <hi>Noah</hi> ſent over Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies into their Countries, and peopled that whole Tract of Land, from <hi>Peru,</hi> as far as <hi>Baccaleos</hi> with Inhabitants. And that afterwards the whole Progeny of <hi>Noah,</hi> within the compaſſe of which the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves are comprehended, ſinned alſo; except ſome few of them only: and that God ſent afterward among them alſo Other Inſtructers; as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and others: whom, when the World believed not, that then God himſelf took Humane Fleſh upon Him, and out of the Infinite Love that he bare us, put on Our Nature; that ſo, making uſe thereof, as of an Inſtrumental Means, He might the more Effectually teach us, what way we muſt take, for to go to Heaven; and how that Truth is to be obſerved in all things: (And all theſe things ſhould have been inſtilled into them by friendly Perſwaſions, and fair Means; and not by force of Arms:) And laſtly, that God himſelf in his own perſon, and by his own Example confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all things that He ever taught; and laid down a Pattern before Us, according to which We ought to walk in this life.</p>
               <p>And that, after He had taught us, that we ought not to be terrified, or affrighted from the Worſhip of our God, even by threats and Death; Himſelf firſt underwent Death, ſuffering it by the hands of Cruel Tyrants, to the end that we might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to follow his ſteps: and that, Riſing again the third day from the Dead, He aſcended up into Heaven, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Him his Vicar upon Earth, who is called by the name of The <hi>Pope;</hi> who ſits in His <hi>Tribunal,</hi> being endowed with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Wiſedom; being aſſiſted alſo by many moſt Valiant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who all mantain the Divine Truth; among whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is the Cheif. And, that now God, being moved with compaſſion towards Them, who were all Idolaters, and Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law of Nature, had ſent their Brethren the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to convert them, and to bring them back again into the way of Truth, and by means of the Pope, and of the King of Spain (from which Country Their World was divided at firſt by the Flood) to bring them home to Him: Adding further, (and ſaying,)
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:118554:112"/>that, God hath given us skill to build Ships, and to tame Horſes, and command the Sea; and hath ſhewed us how to make <hi>Vocal, Speaking Papers;</hi> that ſo, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeeing all theſe things, might the more readily believe us. And that we are able, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe things, to do any other ſuch Miracles as He himſelf did, when He was upon Earth; as namely, Healing the ſick, Raiſing the Dead to life, if ſo be that we be but Obedient to his commands, and be Baptized with water, in the Name of the Only One God, and be cleanſed from Our Sins by His Inviſible Grace. And that He hath given us theſe Arms, to puniſh all thoſe, that ſhould endeavour to hinder the Propagation of the Truth.</p>
               <p>Some ſuch Prologue as this ſhould have been uſed, to winne upon them at firſt: and they ſhould alſo have made choiſe among the <hi>Indians</hi> of ſome ſuch, as by their looks they ſhould have gueſſed to have been the fitteſt to be inſtructed in this Doctrine, and ſhould have inſtilled the ſame into them: and ſhould afterwards have ſent them, like the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the Goſpel, to call their Countrymen, and fellow Citizens, and ſhould have uſed them with all gentleneſſe, and courteſie, and without either Cruelty, or Covetouſneſſe. And they ſhould beſides have perſwaded them, that They regarded Gold as litle as the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves did; and that they made uſe of It on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of Exchange for other things; and deſired to have it, without any Covetous mind at all; letting the <hi>Indians</hi> ſee withall, that they brought them <hi>Iron</hi> for their <hi>Gold;</hi> which is a much more uſeful Mettal, both for the Manuring of the Earth, and alſo for the defence of Mans Life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And then, after all things had been thus carried, they ſhould have preſently clapt abroad their ſhips as many of the Natives as they could, under pretenſe of ſome ſuch Command, given from Heaven, to the Pope and the King of Spain; into whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions they ſhould have carried them, and have diſpoſed of them in Colonies diſperſed up and down through <hi>Africk;</hi> from whence they ſhould afterwards have been conveyed over into <hi>Spain,</hi> to be made to labour there, and to till the ground, and to be inſtructed in Mechanick Arts; mean while that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> themſelves ſhould follow their exerciſe of Arms, and ſo by degrees ſhall ſubdue their whole Country.</p>
               <p>But now, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that firſt landed in thoſe parts, were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:118554:113"/>meer Rude, Boyſterous Souldiers; and ſuch as knew not of how great force the Opinion of Divinity, once raiſed in the minds of men, is, towards the ſubduing of them. But they, as if they had been come into an Enemies Country, fell immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to hunt after their Gold, and to pillage them of what they could; making it plainly appear, that they took litle care of the ſaving of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> Souls; and yet though they never had prepared them at all by preaching Chriſt to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, yet how ever they would needs by threats fright them into Chriſtianity, and force them to be Baptized, and to believe that Chriſt was Crucified for them. Which things certainly at the firſt ſight, could not chuſe but ſeem to them to be moſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; as Namely, that <hi>Water</hi> was able to bring any one to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; or, that God could die: and ſo by this means They at the very firſt became a <hi>Stumbling Block</hi> unto All of them, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, by not obſerving that Apoſtolical Rule; <hi>Praedicate hominibus,</hi> Preach to All men.</p>
               <p>By this means therefore the <hi>Spaniards</hi> comming to be repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Natives, they Preſently fell to killing of them: ſo that the Natives betaking themſelves to the Mountains, the Spaniards then fell to hunt after Men, no otherwiſe then they uſed to hunt after Wild Beaſts; and returning home at night, they made their brags how many <hi>Indians</hi> each of them had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that day: and ſo by this means, they in a ſhort time laid that Country, for the ſpace of three Thouſand Leagues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, utterly Waſt, and voyd of Inhabitants; never conſidering at all, that by the common Tie of Humanity they were their Brethren whom they had ſo Barbarouſly deſtroyed; and that we are All of us deſcended from <hi>Noah;</hi> and therefore that all that are not Baptized, are not preſently to be accounted no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Beaſts.</p>
               <p>But by this means it came to paſſe, that the miſerable Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſeeing that <hi>Gold</hi> was ſo highly eſteemed by the Spaniards, &amp; indeed was more accounted of then the Men themſelves; they grew to be very much offended at them, and ſaid, that The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards deſired to bring them under their ſubjection, only by the <hi>Sprinkling</hi> of a litle <hi>Water</hi> upon them, (meaning that of Baptiſme) but that their Dominion over them, would be the very ſame with that of the <hi>Wolfe</hi> over the ſheep, only to worry them, and tear them in pieces.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:118554:113"/>
               <p>They retired themſelves therefore to the Mountains; and from thence afterwards iſſuing out, they have ſometimes got the better of the Spaniards; in ſo much that to this very day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now pretty well learnt how to deal with them, they have the courage to come out againſt them with their Armes; no longer reverencing them as Gods, but driving them away, and chaſing them as ſo many Ravenous Wolves.</p>
               <p>And from hence ſprung up another Miſcheif alſo; which is, that Spain, which it ſelf was very bare of Men, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding forced to ſend over Colonies into thoſe Parts: and yet for all this, the plain truth of the buſineſſe is, that the Souldiers that were there, were ſo inconſiderable for their Number, in reſpect of that Vaſt Tract of ground, as that they were very hard put to it, to keep what they had hot. For the taking off of which fear from themſelves they fell to Slaughter, and to kill up the Natives out of the way: which is an argument of the greateſt Ignorance, and Cruelty that can be.</p>
               <p>So that I am clearly of opinion, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould make it His buſineſſe rather to people thoſe parts, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of the Inhabitants; then to enrich himſelf only with the Gold and Silver that is fetched away from thence; if ſo be He look after his Own greateſt Advantage, and would continue Lord of that Country. And therefore I would have him in the firſt place to take order, that there be a Catechiſme made, and publiſhed in the Language of the Country; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the people there might be inſtructed, firſt of all, in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Gods Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then would I have a Hiſtory to be compiled from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World down to Chriſt, and ſo continued on to Our times; which ſhould be written in a brief, Compendious Way; according to that ſhort Form which I have laid down in few words, in my Preface to this Diſcourſe; and after the example of the Fathers of the Church, who in converting the Heathens to the Chriſtian Faith, made uſe of the like Compendious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; as, for inſtance, <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> did: and not ſuch Prolixe, tedious Formes, as our Modern Writers uſe now a dayes.</p>
               <p>There ſhould alſo be choſen, out of ſuch of the Natives as are inſtructed in the Principles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſome, who ſhould take upon them the Office of Prieſts, and Preachers;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:118554:114"/>and theſe ſhould be ſent abroad among the reſt of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, that keep about the Mountaines, (to whom the Spaniſh Preachers cannot come) and ſhould offer them their Brotherly Aſſiſtance; and ſhould tell them what things the Pope, and the King of Spain, as in the Name of God, would have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of; and withal, how grievouſly, and ſeverely God had puniſhed our World, by Hereſies, and <hi>Mahumetaniſm,</hi> onely for the former Inhumanity, and Cruelty uſed by the Souldiers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Them: And that now the King hath ſent again to them the ſecond time ſuch Perſons, as ſhould with all mildneſſe and gentleneſſe invite them to receive the Chriſtian Religion. And with theſe ſhould be joyned alſo ſome of Our Preachers; who, after that they had faithfully, and Effectually diſcharged their Office there, ſhould then be preferred to be Biſhops, or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats; that ſo, others, by their example, might be encouraged to do the like; and alſo that thoſe People might know, and ſee, that great Honors are by us propoſed to ſuch men, as we ſend over to them, to teach and inſtruct them.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems alſo to be very Neceſſary to inſtitute ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Order of <hi>Preachers of the New World,</hi> to be expreſſely known by that name; ſeeing that the Buſineſſe ſeems altogether to require it. And the King of Spain muſt alſo take care rather, how that Country may be made Populous, &amp; full of Inhabitants, then how the Natives may be all rooted out. And ſuch among them, as will not be converted to Chriſtianity, He may make Slaves; after the examples of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who alone had forty thouſand Slaves of his own, by whoſe meanes he dug down nine Mountaines, and laid them level with the plain ground; and theſe Slaves the King of Spain may put to row in his Gallies. But as for thoſe that ſhall embrace the Chriſtian Faith, they may be put to learn Mechanical Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as Smiths, and Carpenters, and the like; that ſo the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards themſelves may not need to look after any thing elſe, but wholly to mind the exerciſing of themſelves in Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; following herein the example of <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> whoſe Cuſtome it was, to put all ſuch Priſoners as he had taken in War, to learn the trades of Carpenters, and Smiths; but to keep his own ſubjects cloſe to their Armes onely. I think it fit therefore, that a great number of thoſe Indians ſhould be tranſported over into Spain, and <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſhould be ſet to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118554:114"/>build great Cities all along upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> and of <hi>Aſia;</hi> the ſtrong Holds, and Government of which Cities ſhould be put into the hands of Spaniards onely; but the tilling of the Ground, and the Mechanical Arts ſhould be left to the Indians to follow, or to ſome other the like Slaves of the Spaniards, that ſhould alſo be Chriſtians. And when any of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings ſhould chance to be converted, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported over into Spain, they ſhould have Baronies conferred upon them there, that ſo the Spaniſh Empire might thereby be rendred the more Glorious; and that the <hi>Indians</hi> alſo might by this means be brought by degrees to love us, and our Countries.</p>
               <p>And if the King of Spain had but obſerved all theſe Rules, He might at this day have been poſſeſſed of larger Territories, both in <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> and Spain alſo would have been more Populous, and ſtrong, and the New World much Richer then it is. And therefore in my Opinion, it is the moſt Abſurd thing in the World, for the King to make thoſe parts a Treaſury to ſupply Him with Gold &amp; Silver only, and not rather with Men; ſeeing that theſe later are, of the two, of much the greater Value.</p>
               <p>Now of thoſe Indians being brought up to Trades, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in progreſſe of time to be ſufficiently Hiſpaniolized, the King may make Souldiers alſo: as the Turk is uſed to do with ſuch of our Children as he takes to bring up in his Turkiſh way of life. Then would I have in each ſeveral Province of the New World, an <hi>Auſtrian Seminary</hi> to be ſet up, for the training up of Young Souldiers; who ſhould acknowledge no other Father, ſave the King onely; and another Seminary for Women; of which we ſpake formerly; and likewiſe another for Mariners; of which I ſhall ſpeak more hereafter. And by this meanes it would ſo come to paſſe, that within leſſe then Thirty years, the King would ſo abound with Faithful Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Servants of his own, that He would have no further need to make uſe either of Auxiliaries, or Mercenary Souldiers; and He would hereby alſo winne the hearts of the Indians to him, when they ſhall ſee their Children to be brought up in ſo Liberal and Ingenuous a way of Education, and ſhall find them nothing ſo Rude, and Ill-behaved as they were before; and ſo they will the more readily yield to ſerve the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeing that That part of the World is at ſo vaſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from this of ours, it is neceſſary that theſe Parts ſhould
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118554:115"/>be united, and joyned together as much as poſſibly can be, for as much as there is no Empire but is Lame, and Imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Union.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of Union is, True Religion: and therefore there ought to be ſtrong Caſtles, and Block-houſes erected upon all Havens, and Mouths of Rivers; leaſt the Engliſh breaking into theſe Parts, ſhould bring in Hereſy: whereby the whole Deſign of the Spaniard would be utterly fruſtrated, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And beſides, there ſhould be nothing had in greater Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, where any of theſe People are in Preſence, then the very name of the Pope; that ſo they may be kept the faſter to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And they ſhould be brought alſo to ſue to us, and to deſire us to preſcribe them ſome Rule of Living here, and alſo the Meanes of attaining to Eternal Life hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the Second Place, the King of Spain muſt make himſelf Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord of thoſe Countries; for if there ſhould but any other Chriſtian be choſen King in that Part of the World; Our King were then quite loſt. Now there is none that He need to fear in that point, unleſſe it be ſome Principal Noble Man; eſpecially, if it ſhould chance to be ſuch a one, as is deſcended lineally from ſome of thoſe Worthies, that were the Firſt Diſcoverers of this New World; as, namely, if he ſhould be deſcended from <hi>Columbus,</hi> who firſt of all diſcovered theſe Parts; or elſe from <hi>Corteſius.</hi> So that it ſeemes to be neceſſary, that ſuch as have performed ſuch gallant peices of Service, ſhould be rewarded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with very great Honours; and Preferments: but then it ſhould not be in thoſe Countries, that they themſelves had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. For we know that Marqueſſe <hi>Vaglio,</hi> who was Nephew to <hi>Columbus,</hi> was once very near being choſen King; And even the Vice-Roys themſelves, (as they call them) might eaſily make themſelves Kings, if they pleaſed. And therefore none but ſome Principal Nobleman, that hath great Revenues of his own either in Spain, or Italy, is to be placed as Ruler of the New World; or at the leaſt, ſome Cardinal, or Biſhop, that hath many kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here with us. The keeping of all ſtrong Holds alſo, and Caſtles, is to be committed to ſome Garriſon Captains, who are to expect their reward from the King; and the Vice-Roys are to live, not in any of the ſtrong Holds, but in Cities: and it muſt be ſo ordered, that thoſe that are the Commanders of the ſtrong Holds and Caſtles, and the Vice-Roys, may be as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118554:115"/>much at variance and diſcord, as poſſibly may be. Over ſuch Countries as have been conquered by Portugals, there ſhould be placed Spaniſh Governours; and ſo on the Contrary; thus uniting the two Kingdomes the more; and by this meanes the Kingdom will be the more happily, and the more ſafely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niniſtred. Clergy men ſhould alſo be frequently ſent to theſe ſtrong Holds and Caſtles, to take a view of them; and eſpecially the <hi>Capuchins.</hi> The Authority alſo of Particular men is to be reſtrained; neither ought too great a Power to be granted to any One man, in any matters that are of very great Moment and conſequence; but theſe ſhould be tranſacted by the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, joynt conſent of all, or at leaſt by ſignifying the ſame by their Letters, In like manner as all things that concern the Kings Intereſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> are by a very wiſe courſe therein taken, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be conſidered of by the Kings Embaſſadour, lying Lieger at <hi>Rome</hi> the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Millan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third ſort of Union is of Goods: and therefore my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that the King ſhould do well to divide every New diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Country among the common People, and Maimed Spaniards, according to the Ancient Roman Law, called <hi>Lex Agraria;</hi> joyning with them alſo ſuch <hi>Africans,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> as he had, not long before, tranſported into <hi>Africk;</hi> but ſtill under this Condition, namely that None of them all ſhall account what he poſſeſſes to be his own proper Goods; but muſt reckon upon all to be the Kings; ſave onely what belongs to the Clergy. And Fields, Caſtles, and Offices are to be frequently taken from thoſe that hold them, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of to others; that ſo the Eyes of all may be upon the King onely, in whoſe gift, and at whoſe diſpoſal all theſe things are: yet the fruits of the Earth of every mans Land they may gather and enjoy as their own.</p>
               <p>There ſhould alſo Judges be appointed out of the Clergy, who ſhould aſſign every man what is his Due; and ſhould allot ſo much for the Maintenance of the Clergy, ſo much for to pay Souldiers, and ſo much to be paid to the King for a Tribute. And theſe Judges ſhould take care to ſee, that no <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldier ſhall poſſeſſe any thing as his own, ſave only his Armes; unleſſe it be by chance ſome ſmall Orchard, or Garden, for to recreate himſelf in: but they ſhall all be maintained at the Publick
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:118554:116"/>Charge. And as for ſuch ſons of Souldiers, as ſhall not be fit to ſerve in the Wars, they may be put to the Plough; and in their places, to the end that the whole Power may ſtill be ſolely the Kings, there may be ſome ſuch choſen out among the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as ſhall be thought moſt fit for that purpoſe, and may be trained up to the uſe of Armes. And thus ſhall all things be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the Kings own wiſh, and deſire; and the King himſelf alſo ſhall be beloved above all things; neither will his Subjects deſire to have any ample Poſſeſſions, ſeeing they all depend upon Military ſervice only, by means whereof they are daily enlarged. And when it ſhall be thought convenient ſo to do, there may be Vines, and the Seeds of other things ſent over to them; that ſo they may have wherewithal to delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but yet, let them be ſo ſparingly furniſhed with theſe things, as that they may alwaies ſtand in need of us for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. For, if that the uſe of Vines, the liberty to till the ground, and the exerciſe of Armes, together with the uſe of Printing, and the Building of Ships ſhould be denied them; the King might thereby eaſily incur the Suſpition of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>In the moſt convenient places of that Hemiſphere there ſhould be erected Schools for the ſtudy of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> the <hi>Mechanical,</hi> and other Arts and Sciences; as hath been formerly ſhewed: that ſo the <hi>Conſtellations</hi> of the Heavens, and the Seas, and Countries of that Part of the World may be the more fully diſcovered, and made known.</p>
               <p>I would not have either the Kings, or leſſer Princes of any of thoſe Countries to be killed; but rather to be carried over into <hi>Spain:</hi> For, that will both adde to the Majeſty of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Empire; and will alſo very much win upon the Affections of the <hi>Indians.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut now, for the better preſerving of this Dominion of the <hi>New World</hi> entire to himſelf, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had need to build him a great number of <hi>Woodden Cities,</hi> and to put them out to Sea; which being laden with Commodities, may continually paſſe to and fro betwixt this and the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and by being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually abroad, and ſo ſcouring thoſe Seas, may hinder the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and others, from making any Attempts that way. For the performing of which Deſign, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will have need of very many Ships, which ſhould alſo be very well Manned, with a ſufficient number of Sea-men; which ſhould ſayl about to the <hi>New VVorld,</hi> and round about <hi>Africk, Aſia, Calicut, China, Japan,</hi> and the Iſlands adjacent; ſubduing all where ere they come.</p>
               <p>And all this might eaſily be effected, if that the King would but give his mind to gather <hi>Men</hi> together, rather then <hi>Mony:</hi> ſeeing that it appears evidently enough, that in thoſe Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his againſt <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> He was utterly fruſtrate, and failed of his deſigns, meerly through his truſting too much to his Mony, and his want of Able Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all therefore in all the Iſlands of <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> the <hi>Canaries,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Achipelago,</hi> St. <hi>Lazaro,</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, I would have <hi>Seminaries</hi> to be erected for Mariners, and places appointed all along the Coaſt of Spain, where young youths may be taught to build Ships and Gallies, and may learn to know the Stars, and the uſe of the Mariners Compaſſe, and of the Sea Tables, and Charts: all theſe things I ſay, I would have beaten into the dulleſt heads. And then, whenſoever He deſtroyes any Country, He ought to have more regard to the Captives, then to the ſpoiles of it: and ſo becomming wiſer then formerly, He ſhall change away Gold and Silver for a better ſort of Merchandiſe.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:118554:117"/>
               <p>Secondly, at what parts ſo ever His Navy ſhall arrive. He ſhould make Havens, and erect ſuch Work-houſes; eſpecially at the mouths of Rivers and Bayes, He ſhould cauſe Ships and Gallies to be built; in the manning of which He may make uſe of ſuch Mariners as have been brought up in the foreſaid Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when He hath thus gotten to be well ſtored with Men, He may then treat with the richer ſort among the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> and the <hi>Genois,</hi> and let them know, that they ſhall have both of them free liberty to build themſelves Ships and Gallies, and with the ſame to ſayle round about the New World, which is now almoſt wholly the King of Spains, and to go into the Havens, and to fall upon Towns and Caſtles there, and to keep all the Booty they ſhall there find, to themſelves; only the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves they ſhall deliver up to the King, together with all the Elder Children of both ſexes, for the ſupply of His Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And if they chance to take any whole large Country, they may have whole Baronies beſtowed upon them for their Reward. And by this means both the King wil be enriched, and the <hi>Genois</hi> will become the Inſtrumentts both of confirming and enlarging the Kings Empire: who yet are themſelves ſo rich, as that they are able either of them to ſet forth whole Fleets of Ships againſt the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> and to take in very many Countries for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they pleaſed: and therefore the Kings Navies ought alwayes to be ſo much the greater, and the better provided.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> alſo, <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> and the <hi>Gutland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> are in a friendly manner to be dealt withal, and perſwaded to do the ſame, as is ſaid before; only upon this condition, that they ſhall deliver in their Sons as Pledges, that what places ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall take in, they ſhall not reckon upon them, as gotten to themſelves; nor ſhall introduce Hereſie into the ſame. And by this means they would be the eaſier brought in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the King, even without making War upon them, in like manner as the <hi>Genneſcs</hi> are; and thus by degrees would the whole World be brought over to comply with the Spaniards Cuſtomes, and Manners.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, every ſeventh year ſuch perſons, as are condemned to death, are to be called forth; and, under the ſhew of a gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler puniſhment, are to be ſent away into the Weſt <hi>Indies:</hi> and ſo likewiſe the Children of Hereticks, and of ſuch others as ſhall
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118554:117"/>be conquered by Him, either in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or <hi>Africk,</hi> ſhould be ſent into the Seminaries: that afterwards they may be ſerviceable to the King, both at home and abroad, both in Nautical Affairs, and in the Tilling of the Ground.</p>
               <p>And, I would have the King to be well aſſured, that He hath not more need of any thing, then of Men; and eſpecially, of ſome moſt Experienced, and Able Perſon, for the managing of His Affairs; ſuch as were <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Solon;</hi> of which ſort of Men there are many more to be found now adaies, then there were then; only, by reaſon that they are Obnoxious to other mens envy, they are not ſo much taken notice of as they ought to be. There ſhould alſo be Mathematicians ſent out of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and out of <hi>Germany,</hi> into all parts of the World, for the obſerving of the Motions of the Stars, and what New Conſtellations there are; as alſo to obſerve the Situations of Countries, the depths of the Seas, what Motion they have from the Eaſt toward the Weſt, together with their Ebbings and Flowings, and which of them increaſe when the Moon is twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five daies old, and again decreaſe when ſhe is twenty ſix; and which are fitter for the Summer Voyages, and which for Winter, and under what Star raigning; ſo likewiſe in what parts their waters are thick, and heavy, and in which they are thin &amp; light; and again, which of them are wont to be frozen, and which not: together with all their Rocks, Iſlands, and Shelves: for, the knowlege of theſe things will tend to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spaniſh Monarchy, more then any thing elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. For, God himſelf deſires, that theſe works of His ſhould be known; and He alſo reveales them to all ſuch, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire earneſtly after the knowledge of the ſame.</p>
               <p>There ought alſo diligent notice to be taken of all Habitable Places, and Temperate Climes; and in what parts of the World there are <hi>Pygmies</hi> found, and where <hi>Gyants;</hi> where the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are <hi>Black,</hi> and where <hi>Red;</hi> where <hi>White,</hi> and where <hi>Green;</hi> paſſing along thus in order from one Climate to another. For the perfect knowledge of the World, is as good as the Gaining of That half of It. And God himſelf hath given the World into the Poſſeſſion of the Spaniards, becauſe that They, above all others, have the moſt earneſtly thirſted after the knowledge of the ſame; and becauſe they alſo graced <hi>Columbus</hi> with Honours, and dignities, for that he deſired to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118554:118"/>in the knowledge of World, as being the Handiwork of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this courſe would be alſo of every good uſe, for the bringing under (through their Admiration of the Spaniards,) and alſo the weakning of the Northern People.</p>
               <p>Now, that there may be continually ſafe Paſſage for the Kings Navies to and fro, He ought to ſet up two Orders of <hi>Maritime Knights,</hi> after the example of thoſe of <hi>Malta:</hi> the Maſters of which Orders ſhould have their Reſidence in Spain, and they ſhould be divided into Two Colledges, one of which ſhould be called The <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> and the other, The <hi>Weſtern:</hi> in which theſe Knights ſhould be brought up from their Youth in the ſtudy of <hi>Nautical</hi> Affaires, and the Exerciſe of what ever concerns <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation;</hi> where alſo they ſhould take an Oath, that they will imploy themſelves continually in the ſcouring of the Seas, and uſe their utmoſt endeavours, both for the Protecting, and alſo the Enlarging of the Spaniſh Monarchy; for which purpoſe alſo the Younger Sons of the Barons ſhould be made uſe of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and be imployed in theſe Sea-Services, ſome as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and ſome as common Souldiers only. And if the King would but once reſolve to put all theſe things into practiſe, He would quickly render Himſelf Formidable to the whole World; much more therefore to <hi>England,</hi> which yet He now ſtands in fear of: and beſides, all hopes of being able to put forth any Fleets to Sea, would be quite cut off, both from the <hi>Turks, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and all others whatſoever: and withall, thoſe Salaries which are now ſwallowed up by Idle, uſeleſſe Perſons, would be more profitably beſtowed upon ſuch Worthy, Heroick ſpirits as we here ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>There ſhould alſo be propoſed, for the greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all ſuch ſtout propagators of their Country as <hi>Corteſius</hi> was, ſome Proportionable Rewards; not ſo much of Mony, or Poſſeſſions of Lands; (for theſe ſavour too much of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and may poſſibly by corruption be purchaſed for mony;) but rather of Honours: namely, that they ſhould be allowed to have their <hi>Triumphs,</hi> after the example of the Ancient <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſhould enter into <hi>Spain</hi> under their <hi>Triumphal Arches,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhould be deſcribed ſuch Places as they had taken, together with the manner how thoſe Places were taken by them. They ſhould alſo have their Statues Erected, for their greater Honour;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118554:118"/>and underneath the ſame there ſhould be ſuch New Stars as are found to appear in the <hi>New World</hi> ſet up, wrought in Mettal. Neither can it be imagined, how much good this courſe would do for the preſervation of Military Diſcipline, and alſo for the exciting, and ſtirring up of all Mens minds towards the attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of noble, and high things.</p>
               <p>It would alſo make very much to the buſineſſe in hand, in caſe that the King would but command, that all the famous Acts of what perſons ſoever, whether Commanders, or Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſhould be Publickly recorded, with the Names of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the ſame ſet down to them: for, this would ſerve as a Spur to ſtirre up others to the like Attempts. For ſeeing that thoſe <hi>Monuments</hi> and ſhort <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> that we ſee in ſmall Chappels, do enflame thoſe that are living, through the Deſire of Fame, and excite them to the ſtudy of Virtue; what ought we to think it will do, when Men ſhall ſee that their Names ſhall be recorded in Annals and Hiſtories, and ſhall be carried through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World, and celebrated to all Eternity? In which Particular certainly our <hi>Caſtilians</hi> were very much overſeen; who, notwithſtanding that they performed things moſt worthy to be committed to everlaſting Memory, namely their ſo frequent Compaſſing the Earth about, their finding out of ſo many Iſlands and Continents, and, which is the moſt eminent piece of ſervice of all the reſt, the Diſcovery of the <hi>New World;</hi> yet did they never all this while take care to employ any Able perſon, in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe famous Acts of theirs to Memory, and, after the example of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> to record them in Writing, and tranſmit them over to the Perpetual Memory of Poſterity: Although that the <hi>Portugals</hi> have herein gone far beyond the <hi>Caſtilians;</hi> for they have found out ſuch able perſons, as have publiſhed abroad to the world their gallant Acts, both in Latine, and in their own Native Language.</p>
               <p>The Second ſort of Rewards ſhould reſpect Profit; and this I would have to be the Chiefeſt Dignity, or place of Honour in the Kingdom that ſhould be taken in: the King whereof ſhould be carried over into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhould there be inſtructed in the Catholick Religion; and there ſhould alſo be conferred upon him ſome Barony in <hi>Spain;</hi> to the end that It might ſo be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the more Illuſtrious; and alſo that the reſt of the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes might be given to underſtand; that we put not to death
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118554:119"/>any of the Kings of ſuch Countries as we ſubdue, if that they will but embrace Our Religion; (as, for inſtance, <hi>Motecuma, Atabalipa,</hi> and ſome other petty Kings that we could name:) but rather uſe them with all courteſie, and civility that may be. For, it is Fear of being put to death only, that forces thoſe Princes to take up Armes againſt the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>Buſineſſes of State do all contain in them ſome Certain thing; the not knowing of which, makes all other things both Difficult, and alſo Vain, and to no purpoſe: as in ſayling, there are ſome that ſpread the ſailes, and others that ply their Oares, and ſome again are imployed either in caſting forth, or taking in of Ballaſt; yet are all theſe things to no purpoſe, unleſſe there be joyned with theſe an able Pilot, who by his skilful ſteerage of the Veſſel, ſhall make good, and ſet forward the Labours of all the reſt. And therefore <hi>Spain</hi> eſpecially hath very great need of ſome Wiſe Perſon, that ſhould know in what thing chiefly conſiſts the Stern (as we may call it) of the Kingdom; without the knowledge whereof, all Conceipts, Contrivances, Labours, Charges, and Conſultations whatſoever will come to nothing. After that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. began to think of making a Reformation among the Clergy, all men were ready to put to their helping hand, and aſſiſt in the framing of New Lawes, Orders, and Ceremonies, together with appointing of Faſting daies, and ſuch Habits as every one ſhould wear. But I, living at that time at St. <hi>Sabines,</hi> told them plainly, that all the endeavours of the Commiſſaries were vain; ſeeing that the <hi>Rule</hi> it ſelf was ſufficient for the bringing about of all thoſe things; neither indeed did they know, wherein the main point of the buſineſſe lay. I added moreover, that the whole buſineſſe of the Reformation conſiſted in this, that no one particular perſon of the whole company in Monaſteries, or the like Religious Houſes, ſhould have a Key or Lock to himſelf of his Cell, but that there ſhould be only One Common Key, that ſhould ſerve both for the <hi>Dormitory,</hi> and alſo for every mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular lodging. For this would have been a means at once to have put an end to all Proprieties; and to have kept out all Wanton Books, Gifts, and Obſcene Poetry. But when that the Chief and Principal Governours of this Ship once perceived, that all this would redound to Their Loſſe, there was none of Them then that would ſet his hand to the Stern, nor come to the head of the matter: but they would onely have ſome Lawes to be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118554:119"/>made, concerning Novices only, and ſuch as were newly entred in Religion: but would not hear of any thing at all that touched their own intereſt. And ſo by this means the good Intention of the Pope was utterly fruſtrated, and came to nothing.</p>
               <p>The Kingdome of Spain therefore hath need of ſome Wiſe <hi>Palinurus,</hi> by whoſe Conduct all things may be rightly managed according to the Rules before laid down. Which certainly would much more tend to the advancement of the Majeſty of its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, then any <hi>Macchiavilian</hi> Suggeſtions, and Cunning Deviſes whatſoever, which have nothing of a Good Conſcience in them at all; and which beſides ſerve as a Cloak only, to diſguiſe the Tyranny, and Cruelty of Princes, by arming them with the Law of Majeſty; and which countenance ſuch Abuſes, as even not ſilly Women, much leſſe People that have been accuſtomed to Liberty, can endure. And therefore I cannot ſufficiently wonder, that there ſhould be any that ſhould ſo extol this Impious <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician</hi> to the heavens, as they do; as if His Writings were a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of a Good, and Happy Government. And yet this I do not ſo much wonder, as I am angry at, when I ſee that moſt Vile <hi>Maxime</hi> in Politicks to be admitted in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of State Affaires; namely, That ſome things are Lawful in reſpect of the State, and others in reſpect of Conſcience: Then which Opinion there cannot certainly be imagined any thing to be either more Abſurd, or more Wicked. For, he that ſhall take away, or reſtrain that Univerſal Juriſdiction, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to have over All Things, as well Publick, as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſhewes thereby, that he hath Neither any Conſcience, nor any God. The very Beaſts themſelves are lead by a Natural Inſtinct to ſuch things as are good for them, and refuſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would be hurtful to them; and ſhould the Light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Dictate of Conſcience, which were given unto Man that He might know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt Good and Evill, be utterly Blind in Publick Things, and fail in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that are of the Greateſt Moment? I have had, I confeſſe, I know not what Itch upon me, to give an account in writing of ſuch Points, as that Author ought to be chaſtiſed for with the Rod of Cenſure; and not onely he himſelf, but all his Diſciples, I mean, the Counſellours of Princes, and their neareſt Favorites; for certainly both all the Scandals of the Church of God, and all the Perturbations and hurly burlies that have happened
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118554:120"/>in the whole World have had their riſe from hence. But yet I have thought fit to hold my hand till ſome other time, ſeeing that ſome other have written of the ſame Subject already very copiouſly, and alſo becauſe that the thing is of it ſelf clear enough. And therefore I fell upon another Deſign, whereby I might Illuſtrate the Majeſty of the Spaniſh Empire; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof is a buſineſſe of much greater difficulty, then the Acquiſition. For, Humane Things do, as it were, Naturally encreaſe ſometimes, and ſometimes again decreaſe; after the example of the Moon, to which they are all ſubject. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a moſt High, and weighty undertaking if not ſuch a one as is above the Power of Man, to endeavour to Fixe them, &amp; keep them in one Certain, ſtanding Condition; that ſo they fall not from the pitch they had arrived at, nor grow worſe, and fall to decay. For, in the Acquiſition of any thing, both Occaſion, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and alſo the Enemies Errors, and other the like Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal things do very much aſſiſt; which are yet all of them pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without a Man: But to keep what is got, requires both an Excellent Wit, and ſingular Wiſedom. Valour is of uſe for the getting; but Prudence, and that not Ordinary neither, for the Keeping what is Gotten. For the rayſing of Tumults, and Sedition, the Vileſt Perſons have power enough: but Peace, and Quietneſſe have need of Art and skill to maintain them. The Lacedemonians, that they might ſhew, that it was a buſineſſe of greater moment to keep what was Ones Own, then to poſſeſſe himſelf of what was another mans, appointed puniſhments for thoſe onely that had loſt their ſhield in fight; but not thoſe that had loſt their Sword: and among the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, of old, it was reputed a moſt Heynous crime for a man to have left his ſhield behind him; neither was it Lawful for any man in that Scandalous manner, to be either preſent at their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or to joyn with them in any of their Meetings. The Romans alſo were wont to call <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> the ſhield of their Commonwealth; but, <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> The Sword: And it is certain enough, that they made much more account of <hi>Fabius,</hi> then they did of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Of this Opinion alſo was <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who affirmes in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> that the Office, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Lawgiver doth not ſo much conſiſt in the conſtituting, and Forming of Cities, as in the endeavouring to preſerve them when they are formed, and to make them ſtand firm as long as poſſibly may be.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:118554:120"/>
               <p>Neither need that to trouble us at all, that the Propagators of Kingdoms have alwaies been more highly eſteemed then the Conſervators of the ſame; for the reaſon of this is, becauſe that their Preſent Acts do more affect, and take up the Eyes of men, and do make a greater Noyſe, and ſhew, and are fuller of Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and <hi>Novelty,</hi> which all People ſo dearly love. And this is the reaſon, why moſt people do more applaud, and are delighted to hear of <hi>Expeditions,</hi> and Conqueſts; then they are taken with thoſe other more Peaceful Arts of Preſerving what Men had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gotten: which Arts notwithſtanding, by how much the more Tranquillity, and Quiet they work withal, ſo much the greater both Judgment, and Wit, do they argue to be in him whoſoever he be, that knowes how to make uſe of them. And as Conſtant <hi>Rivers</hi> are much more Noble then ſudden <hi>Torrents,</hi> that are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only by the Accidental falling of ſome Violent Showres of Rain; which yet are with more Admiration gazed upon, then thoſe more quietly-flowing <hi>Rivers;</hi> Juſt ſo is it with the Common People, that alwaies have him in greater Admiration and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Wins Countries, then that preſerves them when they are gotten. And yet the truth is, that it is a much harder Task, (as <hi>Florus</hi> hath alſo obſerved) to preſerve and make good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, then to make one. Theſe things are indeed gotten by ſtrength; but they are kept by Good Lawes. And therefore I ſhall conclude with that of the Poet:
<q>
                     <hi>Non minor eſt virtus, quam quaerere; parta tueri.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>It ſhews as great a Skill.</l>
                     <l>To keep, as Conquer ſtill.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And now I conceive I have treated Copiouſly enough, touching the <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Occaſion</hi> that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ought to make uſe of, both in General, and Particular: notwithſtanding that having been detained ten years in miſery, and being alſo ſick, I could not have the opportunity of furniſhing my ſelf with ſuch things as this buſineſſe required, nor could have the help of any Books; for indeed I had not ſo much as a Bible by me when I wrote this Diſcourſe: ſo that I ſhall the more eaſily deſerve the Readers Pardon, in caſe that I ſhall have any where doatingly failed, either by ſetting down ſome things in ſuch places as were not proper for them; or elſe by writing ſome things twice. I have done what I was able to do; though I could not do what I would willingly have done: the fuller handling of all which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118554:121"/>things notwithſtanding I ſhall reſerve for ſome fitter Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I deſire, that Your Lordſhip would take the pains to peruſe this Tumultuary, ſudden Piece; which yet I hope I ſhall reviſe again, againſt the next Eaſter: and therein I ſhall take the more pains and care, and ſhall take away, and adde, where I ſhall ſee cauſe. This Age of ours hath alſo Its <hi>Solons, Lycurguſſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſephs,</hi> which are ſent by God himſelf: but they are kept under, and are not admitted to the Preſence of Princes: And that Common Saying, namely, that there are no <hi>Solons,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> born now adaies, is moſt falſe. For indeed there are ſuch born even in theſe our daies; and ſuch as are better then they too: but they lye hid, and concealed; whiles that <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> are had in admiration; but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are envied.</p>
               <p>But I would have theſe things committed to Secret Ears: for hereafter, when they ſhall have been viewed over again, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, they will be more eſteemed of, then the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Books were by the <hi>Roman</hi> King. It is not in the power of Envy to hinder me from ſpeaking thus much: for, when thoſe things which I have here delivered ſhall but come to be examined, and made trial of, <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall know what It hath to do, and ſhall perceive how great my deſire is to aſſiſt it in what I may.</p>
               <q>

               </q>
               <p>And thus I ſhall now take leave of Your Lordſhip; whoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Deſerts I deſire, and earneſtly pray, that Almighty God would crown with a happy length of years, and a full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
